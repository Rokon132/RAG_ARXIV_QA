Securing Automated Insulin Delivery Systems: A
Review of Security Threats and Protective Strategies
Yuchen Niu and Siew-Kei Lam
Abstract—Automated Insulin Delivery (AID) systems represent
a significant advancement in diabetes care and wearable physi-
ological closed-loop control technologies, integrating continuous
glucose monitoring, control algorithms, and insulin pumps to
improve blood glucose level control and reduce the burden of
patient self-management. However, their increasing dependence
on wireless communication and automatic control introduces
security risks that may compromise patient privacy or result
in life-threatening treatment errors. This paper presents a com-
prehensive survey of the AID system security landscape, covering
technical vulnerabilities, regulatory frameworks, and commercial
security measures. In addition, we conduct a systematic review of
attack vectors and defence mechanisms proposed in the literature,
following the PRISMA framework. Our findings highlight critical
gaps, including the lack of specific security evaluation frame-
works, insufficient protections in real-world deployments, and
the need for comprehensive, lightweight, and adaptive defence
mechanisms. We further investigate available research resources
and outline open research challenges and future directions to
guide the development of more secure and reliable AID systems.
By focusing on AID systems, this review offers a representative
case study for examining and improving the cybersecurity of
safety-critical medical wearable systems.

I. INTRODUCTION
The management of Type 1 Diabetes (T1D), a chronic
condition where pancreatic beta cells produce insufficient
insulin for regulating blood glucose (BG) levels, remains a
significant challenge for millions of individuals worldwide [1].
As there is no realistic biological cure in the near future,
the treatment primarily involves intensive insulin therapy to
maintain BG levels within a safe range, thereby mitigating
the risk of serious complications caused by hyperglycemia
or hypoglycemia [2]. However, this regimen of frequent BG
measurement and insulin adjustments is time-consuming and
error-prone for patient self-management. To address these
challenges, automated insulin delivery (AID) systems, also
known as artificial pancreas, have emerged as a promising
“technical” solution [3].
AID system integrates a continuous glucose monitor
(CGM), a control algorithm, and an insulin pump to auto-
matically adjust insulin delivery based on real-time glucose
measurements. With recent technological advancements, these

systems have evolved into networked and intelligent medi-
cal wearables that improve glycemic outcomes and quality
of life for individuals with diabetes [4] [5]. Nevertheless,
the increasing device complexity, coupled with their reliance
on wireless connectivity and automated control, introduces
significant safety and security concerns [6]. Ensuring the
trustworthiness and resilience of AID systems against a broad
spectrum of threats is essential for safeguarding patient health
and enabling wider clinical adoption.
Threats to the reliability of AID systems primarily arise
from two sources: unintended failures and malicious attacks.
Unintended failures result from system limitations [3] and
malfunctions [7]. For example, physiological constraints on
delayed insulin absorption and postprandial rapid glucose
fluctuations can limit the effectiveness of insulin delivery.
Technological and behavioural limitations, such as sensor
noise, signal dropouts, miscalibration, or pressure-induced
sensor attenuation (e.g., lying on the sensor during sleep), may
lead to inaccurate glucose readings and inappropriate dosing.
Additionally, malfunctions with CGM and insulin pumps (e.g.,
early sensor failure, occlusion of insulin infusion sets, and
cartridge errors) can further compromise system performance.
Malicious attacks, on the other hand, involve adversaries
exploiting vulnerabilities in AID systems to intercept sensitive
patient data or manipulate insulin delivery. These risks have
escalated with the adoption of wireless communication in
AID systems [8]. Demonstrated attacks include unauthorised
remote control [9] and false CGM reading injection [10].
Early experiments have shown the feasibility of intercepting
communication and launching lethal insulin doses through
unencrypted wireless channels at least 20 meters away [11]
[12]. Recognising these risks, the U.S. Food & Drug Adminis-
tration (FDA) issued warnings in 2019 regarding cybersecurity
weaknesses in AID systems [13], and several commercial
products have been recalled due to security concerns [14].
Strengthening the reliability of AID systems requires a
thorough understanding of existing and emerging threats, a
critical evaluation of defence mechanisms, and the identifica-
tion of gaps that must be addressed. Review papers on the
reliability of AID systems published in the past decade, as
summarized in Table I, most primarily focused on discussing
unintended failures [17] [18] [24] or discussing threats from
malicious attacks without analysing specific attack vectors and
defence mechanisms [3] [19] [20]. While several studies pro-
vided general overviews of cyber vulnerabilities and potential
countermeasures, they lack in-depth examinations of related
studies [15] [16] [21] [22]. Nazzal et al. [23] conducted a
thorough literature review of software verification methods
for AID systems; however, broader security defence strategies

remain unexplored. Besides, while some existing reviews on
Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) security briefly discuss
AID systems, they do not adequately address their distinctive
risks [25] [26] [27].
Compared to most other safety-critical IoMT systems, AID
systems present unique security challenges. First, the physio-
logical closed-loop control introduces substantial interpatient
variability and unpredictable external factors, complicating
threat detection and leaving a narrow window for preventing
attacks from impacting drug delivery. Second, AID wearables
operate under stringent power, computation, and memory
constrained, limiting the feasibility of resource-intensive secu-
rity strategies. These challenges not only amplify the impact
of potential threats but also complicate the development of
effective defence mechanisms. Notably, no prior reviews com-
prehensively examine security threats and protective strategies
for wearable physiologic closed-loop control systems.
To address this gap, this study systematically reviews the
security of AID systems, providing an in-depth analysis of
attack vectors, existing defence strategies, and open research
challenges. We introduce a taxonomy that categorises security
threats and defence mechanisms in AID systems, as illustrated
in Figure 2. With the growing adoption of AID technologies
and the expanding body of related research, this review not
only advances understanding of AID security but also serves as
a representative case study for strengthening the cybersecurity
of other medical wearable systems.
The remaining paper is organised as follows (see Figure
1). Section II presents the methodology and materials used in
the review. Section III examines the security status of AID
systems from technical, legal, and commercial perspectives,
establishing a foundational understanding of the field. Section
IV reviews existing and emerging attack vectors, and Sec-
tion V analyses defence strategies proposed in the literature.
Section VI discusses current evaluation methods and available
research resources. Section VII discusses key findings and
research gaps, and Section VIII outlines future directions for
strengthening the security of AID systems.
II. METHODOLOGY AND MATERIALS
To comprehensively assess the security landscape of AID
systems, this paper adopts a hybrid methodology, integrating
elements of both survey and systematic review. The review
begins with a broad investigation into AID systems cyber-
security, covering technical vulnerabilities, regulatory frame-
works, and security measures in commercial products. The
materials considered extend beyond peer-reviewed journals
and conference papers to include diverse sources such as
clinical studies, industry reports, regulatory standards, product
manuals, and relevant online resources. Following this, the
PRISMA framework [28] was employed for a systematic
review of attack vectors and defence mechanisms proposed in
the literature for AID systems security. To guide this analysis,
the following research questions (RQs) were formulated:
• RQ1: What potential attack vectors and risks do AID
systems face?
• RQ2: How do existing defence mechanisms address these
risks?
• RQ3: How practical and robust are these solutions in
protecting AID systems from cybersecurity threats?
A systematic literature search was conducted across mul-
tiple databases, including Scopus, Google Scholar, Web of
Science, IEEE Xplore, and PubMed. Boolean operators and
keyword variations were applied, as summarized in Table II.

From the initial database search, 53 relevant papers were
identified. To ensure comprehensive coverage, backward and
forward citation tracking was conducted, yielding 23 addi-
tional studies. These were initially missed due to: (1) Broad
scope—studies focusing on medical devices, IoT-based health-
care systems, or cyber-physical systems that take AID systems

referring to AID systems under alternative terms such as
wireless insulin pump systems or sensor-augmented pumps.
Finally, 76 papers met the inclusion criteria for analysing
attack vectors and defence mechanisms in AID systems. The
publication trends over the past 15 years are visualized in
Figure 4. Notably, a significant rise in proposed defence
mechanisms has been observed in the past five years.
III. BACKGROUND
A. Technical Description and Vulnerabilities
AID combines a CGM, an insulin pump, and a controller
algorithm to calculate and deliver suitable insulin doses,
helping to maintain blood glucose levels within the target
range. Figure 5 shows the workflow of a hybrid AID system,
the paradigm common among current available products. In
this system, the CGM periodically (e.g., every 5 minutes)
transmits the measured glucose levels to the control algorithm
device, which calculates basal insulin and corrective boluses
in response to sensor glucose values and meal registration,
and then directs the subcutaneous insulin pump to deliver the
specified dose into the body [30]. Unlike full AID systems
that automate all insulin delivery, hybrid systems require the
user to administer prandial insulin before or at the time
of meals to control post-meal blood glucose spikes [31].
Full AID systems, though promising, still face challenges
in managing postprandial hyperglycemia and exercise-related
glycemic fluctuations [32]. Despite different automation levels,
both hybrid and full AID systems share core modules and rely
on wireless connectivity and software control, exposing them
to similar cybersecurity vulnerabilities.
Cybersecurity concerns the protection of digital assets. In
the context of AID systems, these assets include physiological
and treatment data transmitted wirelessly between system
components, the software controlling processes, and patient
information stored on the device. Vulnerabilities may arise in
both wireless communication channels and individual system
modules, as detailed in the following subsections.
1) Wireless communication: Communication among the
three core components of AID systems primarily relies on
wireless transmissions for wearable convenience, making it
possible for attackers to intercept, disrupt, or manipulate
signals from a distance. Secure information exchange requires

communication protocols that provide robust encryption, au-
thentication, and resilience under emergencies. However, as
examined in [33], protocols commonly applied in AID sys-
tems are often lightweight but fail to meet these security
requirements. For example, the widely used Bluetooth Low
Energy (BLE) protocol is vulnerable to replay and man-in-
the-middle attacks, allowing adversaries to eavesdrop or inject
faulty glucose readings and control commands [34].
2) CGM: A CGM system continuously tracks BG levels in
the patient’s body and transmits the collected physiological
data to the controller every few minutes. It consists of a
disposable glucose sensor, placed under the skin to measure
glucose levels, and a transmitter attached to the sensor that
sends the data to the control algorithm platform. Accurate BG
readings are crucial for safe insulin delivery, as any incorrect
values can potentially result in harmful dosing decisions. How-
ever, a compromised CGM system may operate maliciously by
providing inaccurate BG levels, either due to device tampering
or data manipulation during wireless transmission [11] [12]
[30].
3) Control Algorithms: The controller computes the recom-
mended insulin doses and transmits infusion commands to the
insulin pump. It incorporates patient physiological models to
estimate glucose-insulin dynamics and control algorithms to
determine optimal insulin doses. These computations rely on
real-time sensor data, historical records, and estimated patient
status (e.g., eventual BG, Insulin on Board (IOB)). Control
algorithms may be deployed on smartphones, tablets, personal
computers, or integrated into insulin pumps, which are often
the platforms for user monitoring device activities. Three main
security threats are associated with the controller:
• Data Manipulation: The stored records, received sensor

data, or meal and activities inputs could be tampered
with or falsely registered, compromising the accuracy of
the controller’s calculations [35] [36]. Additionally, alerts
on the display screen could be maliciously triggered or
disabled, prompting users to turn off or ignore the security
monitoring system, thus heightening system vulnerability.
• Compromising controller algorithms: The core logic and
configuration of control algorithms may be altered, re-
sulting in incorrect insulin dosing [37].
• Platform Vulnerabilities: The device running the control
algorithm could be compromised by malware, such as
viruses or worms, which may interfere with the proper
functioning of the AID systems [38].
4) Subcutaneous Insulin Pump: A subcutaneous insulin
pump includes a reservoir, which stores insulin and supplies
it to the delivery system, an infusion set consisting of a thin
tube and a subcutaneous cannula for insulin delivery, and a
microcontroller unit that orchestrates the pump’s functions by
executing programmed commands based on input from the

control platform. Security concerns associated with the pump
arise from device malfunctions (e.g., infusion site failures) [39]
[40] and malicious control I/O operations of the pump [12].
B. Regulation Standards and Guidelines
The regulatory landscape governing the cybersecurity of
AID systems is evolving, with growing recognition of cyber-
security as a critical component of patient safety. This section
examines the regulatory frameworks of the United States (US)
and the European Union (EU). Given the global nature of
medical device markets, many other countries have adopted
regulations that closely align with these standards. Appendix
A summarises the core regulatory standards and guidelines
relevant to AID system cybersecurity in these regions.
In the US, the FDA oversees regulatory compliance for med-
ical devices. Existing legislation and FDA guidance documents
highlight cybersecurity as a key consideration in approval and
inspection processes. Notably, the FDA has issued guidance
for premarket submissions titled ”Cybersecurity in Medical
Devices: Quality System Considerations and Content of Pre-
market Submissions” [41], and for postmarket submissions
titled ”Postmarket Management of Cybersecurity in Medical
Devices” [42]. These documents provide prescriptive and
structured approaches for manufacturers to conduct risk man-
agement and implement cybersecurity controls. In addition,
the NIST’s cybersecurity framework [43] provides a structured
catalogue of typical cybersecurity activities and controls that
enterprises should consider.
In the EU, the Medical Devices Regulation (MDR) [44]
serves as the primary legislative framework, supplemented by
other cybersecurity standards. Annexe I of the MDR, General
Safety and Performance Requirements (GSPR), requires that
medical devices must not fail due to security attacks and
that necessary cybersecurity protections must be in place.
To facilitate implementation, the Medical Device Coordina-
tion Group (MDCG) issued the guidance document “MDCG
201916: Guidance on Cybersecurity for medical devices”
[45], which provides recommendations to manufacturers on
fulfilling MDR cybersecurity requirements. Compared with
FDA guidance, MDCG offers relatively high-level principles
on how to operationalise these activities [46].
While cybersecurity regulations in the US and EU both
require manufacturers to identify, assess, and mitigate cy-
bersecurity risks across the product lifecycle, responsibility
for comprehensive threat modelling and protective measures
implementation rests with the manufacturer. So the approach
and depth are determined by the manufacturer and subject
to regulatory review. This creates challenges in mapping the
broad landscape of security requirements to specific devices
and maintaining up-to-date threat models. Moreover, current
guidelines lack formal mechanisms for establishing confidence
in a product or system’s capacity to defend against or recover
from cyber attacks through independent assessment [47].
To address these limitations, independent organisations and
researchers have proposed complementary approaches. For ex-
ample, the nonprofit organisation Diabetes Technology Society
(DTS) introduced the DTSec (DTS Cybersecurity Standard for
Connected Diabetes Devices) to define AID-specific security
requirements and enable independent compliance assessment
[48]. In addition, to assess the cyber risk against the up-to-date
threat landscape, Shen [49] proposed a cyber risk assessment
method that evaluates Manufacturers Disclosure Statement for
Medical Device Security (MDS2) data sheets against updated
cyber threat intelligence using MITRE ATT&CK. These ini-
tiatives highlight potential directions for evolving regulation
toward more comprehensive and concrete cybersecurity com-
pliance regulations.
C. Commercial Products
With the rising prevalence of diabetes and continued tech-
nological advancement, global demand for AID systems is
rapidly increasing, with the market valued at US$2.34 billion
in 2023 and projected to reach US$5.80 billion by 2032
[50]. Nevertheless, safety and security challenges persist. For
example, by 2023, 24 device failures and recalls were docu-
mented for a single AID system manufacturer [24]. A cross-
sectional survey [6] revealed that concerns regarding privacy
and reliability are one of the major factors that hinder broader
adoption of AID systems. Appendix B summarises the core
components, functions, and security measures of representative
products. Although the cybersecurity capabilities of leading
products have improved, they remain limited in terms of
security protection, risk management, and monitoring.
Experimental studies have demonstrated that two early-
generation AID products lack standard cryptographic mech-
anisms, allowing full reverse-engineering of their wireless
protocols and exposing them to eavesdropping, replay, and
data manipulation attacks [11] [51]. These vulnerabilities
resulted in official warnings of use [52] and product recalls
[9]. Although more recent products employ encryption and
authentication to protect wireless communication, the level of
security depends on factors such as method strength, key man-
agement, and system integration. Even with strong encryption
and authentication, vulnerabilities remain to advanced threats
like side-channel attacks, denial-of-service (DoS) attacks, and
physical tampering.
To address advanced or unknown threats that may bypass
safeguards, robust risk management is essential for ensuring
device reliability under attack. However, risk management
functions in current products are limited. Insulin pumps incor-
porate preset minimum and maximum dosage and infusion rate
limits, while systems like the Medtronic 780G suspend insulin
delivery when glucose levels drop below a predefined thresh-
old. Yet, these threshold-based approaches are ineffective
against more sophisticated attacks. Research has demonstrated
that personalised insulin dose manipulation attacks can subtly
alter insulin delivery in ways that are harmful to specific
patients at particular times while remaining within general
safety constraints [53]. In addition, false data injection attacks
can falsify glucose readings to suppress alarm activation,
and computational attacks can modify algorithm logic [12].
Detecting these attacks requires identifying abnormal patterns
rather than comparing with predefined thresholds.
Meanwhile, the main responsibility for monitoring and
securing devices is explicitly assigned to patients themselves
as indicated in user manuals [54]. However, this expectation
is often unrealistic, especially during sleep or other daily
activities. Besides, the absence of real-time displays in CGM
systems further limits patients’ ability to detect discrepancies
between glucose readings and data relayed to the control
platform.
Given these limitations, there is a pressing need for man-
ufacturers to establish sufficient security measures to prevent,
detect, and respond to security threats in real time without
relying solely on patient intervention. Strengthening security
in this manner is essential to improving system reliability and
fostering user trust.
IV. ATTACK VECTORS IN AID SYSTEMS
Building on the discussion of security vulnerabilities in AID
systems, it is crucial to examine the specific attack vectors that
target these systems. Table III presents a reverse chronological
overview of real-world attacks and emerging threats identified
in the literature, detailing their causes, impacts on device
functionality, and the adversarial capabilities required.
As illustrated in the taxonomy (Figure 2), malicious attacks
on AID systems can be broadly categorised into cyber-physical
attacks and process-aware attacks, based on whether they
exploit knowledge of the system’s dynamic control processes
[55]. Cyber-physical attacks, which are common across var-
ious IoMT devices, compromise system functionality by tar-
geting software, hardware, or communication channels without
requiring an in-depth understanding of the underlying control
mechanisms. In contrast, process-aware attacks specifically
target semi- or closed-loop control like AID systems. By
making subtle manipulations within the operational bounds,
these attacks can significantly impact system behaviours to
threat patient safety [36]. Since cyber-physical attacks align
with broader IoMT security concerns, threats and potential
countermeasures have been detailed in existing surveys [25]
[26] [27]. This section focuses on analysing attack vectors and
technical details that are specific to AID systems.
For systematic analysis, the attack vectors are grouped into
three categories corresponding to the fundamental principles of
cybersecurity: confidentiality, integrity, and availability. Table
IV provides this classification and links the attacks identified in
Table III with feasible countermeasures summarised in Table
V. The following discussion focuses on these attack vectors
and outlines potential countermeasures, whereas Section V
reviews research contributions on implementing such defences
in AID systems.
A. Threats to Confidentiality
Ensuring the confidentiality of diabetes devices aims to
guarantee that sensitive information is accessible only to
authorised users or systems. Threats to this security aspect can
originate from unauthorised individuals or even from patients
themselves.
1) Eavesdropping: This refers to the unauthorised intercep-
tion of wireless communication, which can expose personal
patient information related to therapy and physical condition,
device information, and the device’s personal identification
number (PIN). Laboratory experiments have shown that data
transmitted by a commercial insulin delivery system without
cryptography can be intercepted using off-the-shelf Universal
Software Radio Peripheral (USRP) and free software [11] [51].
By capturing its identification number, attackers could then
gain full control of the pump. At a 2012 security conference,
an engineer showed that a fatal dose of insulin could be
delivered from 300 feet away [108]. These attacks exploit
wireless communication vulnerabilities, such as wide trans-
mission range and inadequate encryption. To mitigate these
risks, countermeasures proposed in the literature mainly focus
on (1) enhancing data protection through cryptography and
secure communication protocols, and (2) limiting transmission
range by employing proximity communication channels.
2) Do-it-yourself (DIY) hacking: This refers to unautho-
rised access or modification of commercial diabetes devices
by patients themselves, driven by the desire for better data
visualisation and more advanced control with shorter official
censor and approval time [15]. For instance, Nightscout is
an open-source project that helps patients hack their Dex-
com CGMs for remote glucose level monitoring on mobile
devices. Projects such as #DIYPS enable patients to control
insulin delivery. While these initiatives empower patients, they
introduce risks due to vulnerabilities in unauthorised software
and users’ potential lack of expertise. Compared to FDA-
regulated medical devices, these systems lack rigorous testing
and responsible parties to support them in case of problems.
To balance the need for patients to have greater control with
secure AID systems against malicious exploitation, it is crucial
to implement robust authentication strategies.
B. Threats to Integrity
The integrity of AID systems ensures that their data,
algorithms, and operations remain accurate and consistent.
Integrity can be compromised through two key aspects: data
manipulation and algorithm manipulation.
1) Manipulation of Data: Attackers can manipulate wire-
lessly transmitted data, such as CGM readings or controller
commands, to mislead the control algorithm or insulin pumps
into issuing incorrect insulin delivery. Data manipulation can
occur through the following attack vectors:
• Replay attacks: These attacks involve intercepting and
replaying legitimate data packets to manipulate insulin
delivery [61] [52]. This type of attack is possible when
systems lack freshness checks or authentication, and
attackers can observe and record communications. It does
not require device access or message decryption.
Once the attacker gains access to the device (e.g., by
accessing the PIN) and decrypts the message, they can craft
forged data packets to be accepted by the device [11], enabling
bias injection and false data injection attacks.
• Bias Injection Attacks: In this attack, the attacker skews
sensor readings by injecting a bias [35]. By making
subtle, consistent changes, the attacker can cause the
system to under- or over-deliver insulin without needing
extensive knowledge of the patient model or system
operations. They can be difficult to detect due to their
subtlety and correlation with the original data [109].
• False Data Injection Attacks (FDIA): FDIA refers to
an adversary deliberately manipulating measurement or
communication data to affect system state estimation or
control decisions. They can be broadly categorised into
random and targeted types, depending on how the data is
forged. Random FDIA introduces arbitrary perturbations
into input data. Experiments in [59] showed that such
attacks can shift the outputs of deep learning (DL)
based glucose prediction models by 10-20 mg/dL under
different scenarios. These attacks are generally easier to
detect using sequential change detection techniques.
In contrast, targeted FDIA carefully crafts input values
to evade alarms and cause deliberate harm. This belongs
to process-aware attacks that require knowledge of the
control algorithm, which is often detailed in documenta-
tion. These attacks can be divided into model-specific
and patient-specific variants. Model-specific FDIA ex-
ploit vulnerabilities in the target model; for example,
Elnawawy et al. [57] used URET to craft semantically and
functionally plausible adversarial data points for interfer-
ence AI models, while Kashyap et al. [59] formulated
this attack as an optimisation problem, showing that
minimal, hard-to-detect perturbations against DL-based
models can be computed within 60 milliseconds. Patient-
specific FDIA endangers selected individuals, such as
personalised insulin dose manipulation attacks craft at-
tacks that harmful for target patients and within safety
constraints [53], register false states (e.g., meal intake) to
covertly mislead the control logic [36], or remote control
insulin delivery [11] [12] [51].
Defence strategies for these data manipulation attacks typi-
cally include developing intrusion detection systems to detect
abnormal patterns in sensor data and assessing controller
activities. Another defensive measure involves using additional

inconsistencies.
2) Manipulation of Algorithms: Algorithm manipulation
involves tampering with the computational logic or parameter
settings of AID systems, targeting either control algorithms
or physiologic models used for patient state prediction [37].
These include both traditional rule-based algorithms and ma-
chine learning(ML)-based models.
• Computational attacks: These attacks may compromise
instructions or internal data in algorithm execution [37].
For example, Aliabadi et al. [110] identified that the
synchronisation between CGM and controller could be
manipulated by altering the timing function (get-data-
timer()). This modification allows attackers to delay or
drop critical messages. Other threats involve tampering
with essential device settings, such as disabling pump
alarms, modifying the maximum dosage limits [12] or
pump I/O operations [62].
• ML model attacks: ML models are increasingly used in
AID systems to enhance performance [111]. For instance,
the FDA-approved One Drop Blood Glucose Monitoring
System employs a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) model
for glucose prediction. Deep reinforcement learning (RL)
approaches have been explored for use in AID systems
for BG control [112]. However, due to their black-box
and data-dependent nature, understanding and monitor-
ing the reasoning behind these models is challenging.
Attackers may influence the model’s behaviour during
training or inference phases or reverse-engineer the model
to extract confidential information [57]. Moreover, ML-
based algorithms can be severely interfered with by a very
slight input data perturbation that is hard to detect—an
attack variant described as ripple FDIA [59]. In [59],
minimal interference was calculated to misguide the
ML model into predicting a patient’s glucose level as
hyperglycaemic, leading the controller to administer an
excessive dose of insulin. Experiments in [56] show that
a small perturbation around ±1mg/dL on BG reading can
lead to severe patient harm over time in an RL controller
model.
To defend against algorithm integrity threats, formal verifi-
cation techniques are often employed to assess the operations
of rule-based algorithms. For ML-enabled systems, where
the black-box nature poses challenges for formal verification,
intrusion detection systems and modelling insulin injection
patterns can be used to detect abnormalities and inconsisten-
cies.
C. Threats to Availability
Availability in the context of AID systems refers to ensuring
that the system and its components remain reliably functional
for data transmission, processing, and regular operations.
Threats to availability potentially lead to failures in glucose
monitoring or delays in insulin delivery. Key threats include:
• Denial-of-Service (DoS) and Distributed DoS (DDoS): In
these attacks, an adversary floods the system with exces-
sive traffic, overwhelming AID systems and preventing
legitimate requests from being processed promptly [62].
This could lead to delays or complete failure in delivering
insulin [58].
• Ransomware Attacks: Ransomware can encrypt data and
lock critical components of AID systems, demanding
ransom payments to restore access [63]. This can prevent
patients or healthcare providers from viewing essential
data, such as glucose levels or delivery history, rendering
the system inoperable until resolved.
• Jamming Attacks: By interfering with the wireless com-
munication frequency, attackers can interrupt data flow,
causing the system to fail to deliver insulin as required
[10].
• Firmware/Software Corruption: Malicious firmware or
software corruption can cause AID systems devices to
malfunction or stop functioning entirely [63]. For ex-
ample, saturation-based sensor spoofing attacks make a
sensor ignore legitimate inputs by using an additional
infrared source to saturate the sensors [60]. Additionally,
attacks may exploit software vulnerabilities or delivering
harmful updates can prevent systems from operating as
intended, leading to a cessation of insulin administration.
• Routing Protocol Information Attacks: Manipulating data
transmission pathways in networked AID systems, at-
tackers can disrupt or delay communication between
key system components, compromising timely insulin
delivery and glucose monitoring [64].
Mitigation strategies for these threats include network traffic
monitoring, secure communication protocols, authentication
mechanisms, formal verification, and redundant hardware or
software components.
V. DEFENCE STRATEGIES FOR AID SYSTEMS
Addressing the wide range of potential cyberattacks on AID
systems requires comprehensive defence strategies that span
multiple system layers. Defence mechanisms in AID systems
can be grouped into three primary areas: protected commu-
nication, intrusion detection systems, and control strategies
assessment. Besides these internal defences, external strate-
gies—such as the use of redundant hardware or software
components—are employed to detect abnormal activities in-
dependent of AID devices. Table V provides an overview of
the defence types and corresponding methods proposed in past
research.
A. Protected Communication
Cyberattacks often exploit vulnerabilities in wireless com-
munication channels. A variety of defence mechanisms have
been proposed to enhance the security of information trans-
mission within AID systems, including advanced authentica-
tion methods, encryption techniques, secure communication
protocols, and specialized communication channels.
1) Authentication Methods: Reliable authentication is cru-
cial for ensuring secure communication within AID systems
and for only allowing remote control with trusted devices.
Several authentication methods have been explored to meet the
high-security and low computational demands of AID systems.
Biometric authentication methods like fingerprint recogni-
tion [65] [66] and voiceprint analysis [67] are user-friendly
and offer strong uniqueness. However, they require active user
intervention, making them more appropriate for infrequent
control operations (e.g., bolus injections) rather than con-
tinuous biosignal transmissions that occur periodically (e.g.,
every 5 minutes). Moreover, they raise concerns regarding the
secure storage of sensitive biometric data, which could be
spoofed by advanced attacks. To enhance system autonomy
and reduce the risk of key leakage, hardware-based security
methods such as Physically Unclonable Functions (PUFs)
exploit inherent and unique physical variations in manufac-
turing processes, offering low computational overhead and
an unclonable security mechanism without the need for key
storage [68] [69]. Additionally, blockchain technology has
been explored to protect patient data by decentralising data
storage in central cloud servers [68]. Rahmadika et al. [70]
further incorporated blockchain with federated learning for
sharing local parameters for the misbehaviour detection model
in AID systems without compromising patient privacy.
2) Encryption Techniques: Following successful authenti-
cation, establishing encrypted communication between AID
systems components is vital for maintaining data confidential-
ity and integrity. A key challenge is the energy and computa-
tional constraints. High-complexity encryption algorithms can
introduce excessive computational overhead, reducing trans-
mission frequency and accelerating battery depletion—which
could hinder the system’s ability to respond promptly to
critical scenarios. Another challenge is key distribution. While
private key encryption enhances security, it may prevent med-
ical professionals from accessing patient data in emergencies
[74].
To address these challenges, several studies have proposed
encryption methods specifically tailored for AID systems.
Table VI summarises these approaches, detailing their method-
ologies, key sizes, security strengths, and limitations.
Li et al. [11] first demonstrated the vulnerability of wire-
less communication between glucose monitors and insulin
delivery systems due to the lack of standard cryptography;
they proposed using rolling code-based encryption—similar to
that used in garage door systems—to prevent eavesdropping
and replay attacks. However, the security of rolling code
methods does not offer strong authentication and is highly
dependent on encryption and decryption algorithms. Some
methods, such as Keeloq, have been successfully compromised
[113]. To enhance security, Marin et al. [51] employed Ad-
vanced Encryption Standard (AES), a more robust symmetric
encryption algorithm. Additionally, they reduced message size
and transmission frequency to optimize computational effi-
ciency. Their experiments also revealed that authentication for
messages consumed more energy than encryption due to the
need to append a message authentication code (MAC), which
inevitably increased message length. A more lightweight so-
lution proposed by ForkAE [12] combined encryption and
authentication processes to reduce computational overhead.
Both AES and ForkAE rely on symmetric encryption, where
a public key is used for both encryption and decryption.
However, this approach carries the risk of key interception. To
mitigate this problem, asymmetric encryption was introduced
in [65], using a private key in every packet. While this ap-
proach enhances security, it requires larger key sizes, resulting
in higher computational costs and vulnerable to factorisation
attacks. To further protect patient privacy during computation,
Weng et al. [71] proposed using homomorphic encryption
within a PID-based controller. This approach enables secure
data processing without key sharing, as it allows computations
to be performed on encrypted data. However, the CKKS
homomorphic encryption method used in their study does
not support division and comparison operations, potentially
leading to imprecise computational results. Moreover, its high
computational demands limit its application to more complex
controller algorithms.
3) Secure Communication Protocols: A communication
protocol defines the rules and standards for data exchange be-
tween devices, including authentication and encryption meth-
ods, to ensure secure and efficient transmission. Traditional
high-security communication protocols often fall short in AID
systems due to their substantial computational and energy
demands. In contrast, low-power communication protocols like
Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE), commonly used in IoT devices,
often lack security robustness.
When applied in AID systems, the absence of robust
authentication mechanisms in BLE makes it vulnerable to
man-in-the-middle and replay attacks. To address this concern
in AID systems, Kwon et al. [72] proposed a protocol that
introduces mutual authentication with 35.7% less computa-
tional overhead compared to BLE. Kim et al. [33] proposed
a security protocol dedicated to AID systems by establishing
tripartite authentication and a secure channel which is more
resilient in emergencies. Except for authentication, the original
protocol of a CGM (Dexcom G4) has been demonstrated to
lack encryption [10], leaving it susceptible to eavesdropping
and integrity attacks. To mitigate these threats, Reverberi
and Oswald enhanced its protocol by incorporating AES-128
encryption and authentication, and introduced random keys
and frequencies to protect against jamming attacks [10]. While
this approach mitigates simple narrow-band jamming, it re-
mains susceptible to high-power wide-band or more advanced
jamming techniques. Strydis et al. [63] introduced an energy-
efficient protocol that runs on a separate core powered by RF-
harvested energy until it performs external reader authentica-
tion. This approach reduces the energy burden and enhances
the system’s resilience to battery DoS attacks.
4) Proximity Communication Channels: Besides protecting
the data transmission process, limiting transmission range
through proximity-based communication can reduce the risk
of data interception and manipulation. Li et al. [11] proposed
hiring body-coupled communication (BCC) that uses the hu-
man body as the wireless communication medium, which
reduces wireless interception risks and power consumption.
Limitations include that BCC can be affected by variations
in body conductivity and movement. An alternative is visual
light communication [73], which transmits data over short
distances using visible light. This approach makes interception
difficult and prevents remote attacks from hidden locations, but
is sensitive to obstacles and ambient light, limiting its use to

B. Intrusion Detection Systems
Monitoring and analysing system activity and states is vital
to detect any intrusion and abnormal behaviours, ensuring
the proper functioning of AID systems. Intrusion Detec-
tion Systems (IDS) have emerged as a key defence mech-
anism to counter threats. These systems are classified into
three primary types: signature-based, specification-based, and
anomaly-based approaches. Details of the intrusion detection
system developed for AID systems—including proposed meth-
ods, targeted threats, experimental datasets, and performance
metrics—are summarised in Appendix C.
1) Signature-based IDS: Signature-based IDS detects ma-
licious activities by comparing real-time system behaviour
against a database of known attack patterns. For example,
Zhang et al. [74] detect malicious data transactions in AID
systems by defining abnormal physical signal characteristics
and behaviours of the underlying content. The patterns of
replay and DoS were defined in [58], and computational, data
integrity, and communication attacks were defined in [37].
For unintended failure detection, Howsmon et al. [75] hired
patient-specific metrics to monitor infusion site failures, and
Baysal et al. [76] defined sets of rules for detecting pressure-
induced sensor attenuations.
One key advantage of signature-based IDS is its lightweight
computational overhead, making it well-suited for resource-
constrained medical devices. However, it is ineffective against
zero-day (unknown) attacks. Besides, updating signature
databases in AID systems presents a challenge due to the
stringent regulatory approval processes for medical devices.
Despite these limitations, signature-based IDS can serve as
a first-line monitor by rapidly filtering known threats and
combining with other IDS capable of detecting unknown
attacks to offer more robust defences.
2) Specification-based IDS: Specification-based IDS iden-
tifies malicious activities by comparing system behaviour to
predefined rules or models that outline the expected operations
of the device. Several studies have been conducted to improve
formal specifications for AID systems, aiming to enhance
precision and efficiency.
To mitigate the high resource demand of specification-based
IDS for real-time performance, Chen et al. [77] proposed
a simplified multi-basal insulin infusion control model for
verification, which addresses time-triggered jumps and merges
flow pipes over the same time interval. Alshalalfah et al. [79]
integrated statistical analysis with formal methods, employing
statistical model checking to minimize exhaustive state explo-
ration. Subsequently, they proposed a dynamic specification
mining approach using Bayesian networks to refine rules,
reducing computational load while maintaining detection ac-
curacy [81]. Khan et al. [37] introduced a declarative property-
based approach, specifying only the initial and final states
rather than all intermediate states in a runtime monitor.
Rigid thresholds present another issue, as they may not
adapt well to individual patient variability. Zhou et al. [78]
tackled this by personalising thresholds through adversarial
training on fault-injected data, enabling more precise monitor-
ing. Beyond internal system states, unsafe AID system opera-
tions can manifest as external abnormalities, such as repeated
bolus requests or mismatches between insulin delivery and
meal intake. Prematilake et al. [82] developed a rule-checking
mechanism that monitors both extrinsic and internal states.
An ideal specification-based IDS is effective in defending
against unknown attacks. However, constructing comprehen-
sive rule sets to capture the complex and dynamic interactions
within closed-loop insulin delivery systems, while limiting
computational overhead, remains a challenge in practice.
3) Anomaly-based IDS: Anomaly-based IDS identifies de-
viations from expected data patterns to detect abnormal activ-
ities. These approaches are generally categorised into model-
based and model-free methods.
Model-based approaches consider a T1D patient as a dy-
namic system, where the glucose concentration g(t) is influ-
enced by the insulin injection i(t) and process disturbances
m(t) (e.g., meals and other patient activities). Intrusions are
detected by comparing model predictions with observations.
Based on the type of model, these approaches are further split
into physiological model-based and data-driven model-based
methods.
Physiological model-based methods utilise mathematical
models to represent T1D patient profiles, often integrating
predictors such as Kalman filters for state estimation. Early
work by Vega-Hernandez et al. [84] leveraged Hovorka’s non-
linear predictive model [114], while Avila and Mart´ınez [89]
combined the Lehmann and Deutsch model with a stochastic
process to detect insulin pump issues.
Several studies have focused on improving the prediction
accuracy of these models. Tosun et al. [86] added sequential
change detection mechanisms to improve detection speed and
proposed a KL-divergence bias-sensitive filter to improve
the detection rate of constant bias injection attacks [88]. To
distinguish unregistered meals that caused false alerts, they in-
troduced an online meal estimator using χ2 test with adaptive
thresholds [35], which was later enhanced by including the
statistical evaluation of prediction error [87]. A comparison of
three nonlinear predictive filters for online drift detection in
BG data was presented in [85].
The advantages of physiological model-based approaches
include the use of expert knowledge, explainability, and a
reduced requirement for extensive patient data. However, their
accuracy is highly dependent on the fidelity of the underlying
model and patient parameters, which at most can only partially
approximate the complex and dynamic physiological processes
of the human body.
Data-driven
model-based
methods
rely
on
learning
glucose-insulin dynamics from collected data. Early methods
primarily employed statistical or linear models to represent
these dynamics. For example, multivariable statistical mon-
itoring methods were used in [97] for detecting faults in
glucose concentration values. Facchinetti et al. [90] proposed
individualized linear models to improve glucose predictions at
night, which Del Favero et al. [91] later expanded to cover day-
long monitoring by incorporating meal effects. To distinguish
between unannounced meal interference and pump malfunc-
tions, they introduced two different sets of parameters in a
personalized autoregressive moving average model [92]. This
work was further enhanced by incorporating a comprehensive
analysis of various statistical properties associated with the
residuals [93].
In recent years, ML and DL methods have been applied
to model glucose-insulin dynamics. For instance, Olney et
al. [94] employed nonlinear autoregressive neural networks
to detect and correct errors in CGM data, while Mahmud
et al. [29] individualized this model to enhance prediction
performance. Rahmadika et al. [70] developed a BiLSTM-
based two-tier system for anomaly classification based on
predictive deviations. Beyond modelling glucose-insulin dy-
namics, Maity et al. [95] proposed to model the system’s
operational characteristics and detect attacks by periodically
relearning the model and comparing coefficients.
Though high detection accuracy is achieved with these
models, they often lack explainability and may not perform
well on out-of-distribution data. To address these limitations,
Venugopalan et al. [62] suggested complementing ML-based
models with personalised physiological models to enhance
robustness. Zhou et al. [96] incorporated unsafe action specifi-
cations into the training process using semantic loss regulari-
sation. Building on this approach, they later introduced a data-
driven hazard mitigation method that uses the desired sequence
of recovery states to generate a corresponding sequence of
control actions [98].
A key challenge faced by model-based IDS is that their
performance depends on the accuracy of the patient model.
However, the model highly varies between patients and fluc-
tuates over time [78]. Fixed models that do not account for
these dynamic changes will struggle to maintain consistent
performance over time. This underscores the need for person-
alised models that can continuously adapt to patients’ evolving
physiological state to ensure reliable and effective anomaly
detection.
Model-free anomaly detection methods leverage data-
driven classification techniques to identify abnormal patterns
without requiring a patient-specific physiological model. These
methods are divided into supervised and unsupervised ap-
proaches based on the need for labelled abnormal data.
• Supervised Learning: These methods train classifiers on
labelled datasets to recognise faulty or attacked data. Ro-
jas et al. [99] mapped labelled data onto a feature map and
defined boundaries for the “faulty” class, flagging patient
glucose trends that enter this region. Judith et al. [100]
employed a multilayer perceptron model for classifying
biometric data and network flow metrics. Despite their
effectiveness, supervised methods face challenges due to
the rarity and difficulty of obtaining labelled faulty or
attacked data in the real world.
• Unsupervised Learning: To address the lack of la-
belled data, Meneghetti et al. [104] used 2 unsupervised
anomaly detection methods: Local Outlier Factor and
Connectivity-based Outlier Factor. Then they evaluated
several unsupervised algorithms with feature selection
techniques on simulated AID systems malfunction data
[101]. Later, they extended this work to real patient
data, enhancing the differentiation between normal and
abnormal by adjusting the data segmentation [102]. Their
follow-up study used a larger clinical dataset and adapted
features for cases without meal announcements [39].
Herrero et al. [103] demonstrated that training a support
vector machine to classify CGM data streams could
accurately identify individual patient data. This method
potentially aids in the detection of compromised data by
reidentification.
While model-free methods bypass the need for profiling a
physiological model, they still face challenges like managing
false positives, optimizing feature selection, and handling data
distribution shifts to maintain effective anomaly detection in
AID systems.
4) Hybrid methods: Hybrid methods combine various IDS
approaches to enhance detection accuracy and robustness.
For instance, Astillo et al. [105] merged model-based and
model-free approaches, using deep learning models to forecast
glucose levels and classify anomalies. They also incorporated
outlier detection into specification rules to capture deviations
in glucose data [30] [80]. Venugopalan et al. [62] combined
formal verification of critical system components with ma-
chine learning for insulin prediction, applying patient-specific
safety thresholds. These approaches leverage the precision of
specification-based or model-based methods and the adaptabil-
ity of machine learning for more robust AID systems security.
C. Control Strategies Assessment
To prevent abnormal insulin delivery resulting from com-
promised CGM data, controller algorithms, or insulin admin-
istration, various defence strategies have been developed to
evaluate and verify insulin dose control mechanisms. These
strategies can be categorized into rule-based, data-driven, and
hybrid approaches.
1) Rule-based methods: Rule-based methods compare in-
sulin doses against predefined thresholds or patterns for
anomaly detection. Khan et al. [37] used static threshold
ranges to detect overdoses or underdoses, which, while ef-
fective for extreme deviations, fail to capture sophisticated
attacks that account for patient variability. To improve this,
Zhou et al. [78] introduced personalised thresholds and specific
abnormal behaviours to align control actions with patient
needs. However, this method detects anomalies after the pa-
tient’s physiological response to the attack becomes apparent,
leaving less time to prevent harm, especially in the case of
underdosing, where adverse effects manifest more subtly.
2) Data-driven
methods:
Data-driven
methods
detect
anomalies by predicting insulin doses using historical data,
aiming to enhance timeliness and accuracy. Hei et al. [106]
employed supervised learning to model normal infusion
dosages and rates against time. However, their approach as-
sumes rigid patient routines, limiting applicability, especially
in pediatric cases. Levy-Loboda et al. [53] exploited more
data sources such as the logs of the insulin pump, CGM,
and relevant medical information. They simulated insulin
dose manipulation attacks and mined temporal patterns to
identify anomalies using Logistic Regression and Random
Forest. However, their study focused only on nighttime basal
injections, neglecting other activities like meals and bolus
doses.
A significant gap remains in the development of comprehen-
sive models that integrate patient activities, meal intake, and
physiological dynamics to enable accurate and robust profiling
of insulin delivery patterns.
D. Redundant Hardware or Software Components
External defences employ redundant hardware or software
components to detect abnormalities without adding computa-
tional strain to AID systems, allowing for independent updates
without recertification for the medical device. For hardware
auxiliary components, Strydis et al. [63] designed an energy-
efficient communication protocol that runs security functions
separately from core medical operations, minimising interfer-
ence with the primary system. MedMon [74] utilised a USRP
device to intercept and analyse the signal and content features
of remote controller commands. user authentication was re-
quired if abnormalities were detected, thereby enhancing secu-
rity. This approach demands fast computation speed and may
require frequent user interaction. Panda et al. [83] integrated
a wearable ECG sensor to detect anomalies by correlating
ECG intervals with blood glucose levels, improving system
robustness but facing challenges in accurately correlating
data across varied patient conditions. For software auxiliary
components, an additional safety layer for control algorithms
has been proposed to prevent the controller from violating
constraints with medical criteria [107]. A virtual auxiliary
system with detection filters was introduced to identify replay
cyberattacks [61].
While these external defences provide added protection
without affecting device performance, they may be vulnerable
to initial compromise and can be combined with internal
security measures for comprehensive AID systems protection.
VI. EXPERIMENT SETTINGS AND AVAILABLE RESOURCES
Evaluating security systems for AID systems requires
datasets that capture both the effects of cyberattacks on de-
vice functionality and the resulting physiological changes in
patients. However, collecting such data through experiments
is impractical due to safety concerns. Besides, clinical data
involving suspicious behaviour linked to cyberattacks is rare
and difficult to label. These limitations often necessitate the
use of simulation tools for testing and validating defence
mechanisms. This section reviews evaluation methods and
key experiment resources, including hardware, simulators,
and datasets used in AID systems security research. Table
in Appendix D summarises the key experimental resources,
detailing their descriptions, available sources, and relevant
applications.
A. Hardware Simulation
Hardware simulations offer detailed insights into physical
aspects such as communication, energy consumption, and heat
dissipation, which are crucial for assessing the real-world
application of security measures. These simulations focus on
evaluating system-level vulnerabilities and performance for
defence at the communication and external levels.
Commercialised connected diabetes devices are key re-
sources for hardware simulation. These devices serve a dual
purpose: demonstrating cybersecurity weaknesses and validat-
ing defence mechanisms. For example, Li et al. [11] and Marin
et al. [51] showed that radio communications in commercial
AID systems can be intercepted and compromised using a
USRP. Conversely, Zhang et al. [74] used a USRP as the safety
monitor for wireless communication, and Lazaro et al. [65]
tested a communication protocol by combining a commercial
CGM, insulin pump, and control algorithm.
Some studies focus on improving the hardware or soft-
ware of AID systems to enhance security and validate the
efficiency of their methods. These studies often use more
general and flexible hardware boards to replicate the system.
For instance, Strydis et al. [63] used Biostator II, an ultra-low-
power ASIC controller, to evaluate the energy efficiency in the
proposed security communication protocol. Zhao et al. [73]
simulated on an Arduino Uno-R3 microcontroller to assess
a visible light access control channel. The Arduino platform
was also employed for hardware-in-the-loop simulation to
test controller algorithms [115] and simulate the responses of
cyber-attacks [116] in AID systems. Prematilake et al. [82]
implemented a safety-enhanced insulin pump system on the
EFM32WG to monitor both external and internal states. Kim et
al. [33] tested an AID systems-specific secure communication
protocol using an Arduino Nano 33 for the insulin pump,
an nRF52840 kit for the CGM, and a Galaxy S20 for the
controller. Ahmed et al. [117] developed a hardware emulation
platform using an ESP8266 kit to emulate faults, attacks,
and test countermeasures for evaluating closed-loop control
systems.
In summary, by leveraging commercial medical devices and
custom hardware setups, researchers can identify cybersecu-
rity weaknesses and assess the real-world impact of security
measures on AID systems’ performance.
B. Software Simulation
Software simulation, also known as in silico trials, plays
a crucial role in evaluating closed-loop insulin delivery sys-
tems by mimicking patient responses to various controller
strategies and potential cyberattacks. This approach enables
researchers to simulate how attacks targeting CGM readings
or insulin delivery commands affect the human body and
assess the effectiveness of defence mechanisms at the intrusion
detection and control strategies evaluation level. Closed-loop
AID testbeds typically integrate T1D patient simulators that
combine pharmacokinetic models with meal and activity sim-
ulations, and controller algorithms.
Pharmacokinetic models are mathematical representations
that describe the absorption, distribution, metabolism, and
elimination of drugs (e.g., insulin or glucagon) in the body.
They are primarily used to predict drug concentration-time
profiles and optimise dosing regimens. For example, Bagade
et al. [118] utilise a hybrid physiologically-based pharmacoki-
netic model [119] to assess the computational overhead of
controller algorithms running as Android services and Vega-
Hernandez et al. [84] leveraged Hovorka’s nonlinear predictive
model (i.e., Cambridge model) [114] for state estimation.
Beyond simulation, these models have also been incorporated
into physiologic model-based intrusion detection systems to
support prediction and anomaly detection [85] [35].
T1D patient simulators are integrated platforms that model
the entire glucose-insulin regulatory system, often incorpo-
rating physiological variability and patient behaviours (e.g.,
meal timing, insulin dosing decisions). They are used for in
silico clinical trials, testing new therapies, and simulating real-
life scenarios. One widely used model is the Padova/UVA
T1D simulator, an FDA-approved nonlinear simulator for pre-
clinical testing [90] [91] [30] [105] [62]. This simulator
captures interpatient variability by simulating 100 virtual sub-
jects covering children, adolescents, and adults with varying
physiological profiles. Since its initial release in 2008 [120], it
has evolved to model patient physiology changes over time in
2013 [121] and included intraday insulin sensitivity variations,
time-varying therapy parameters, and a ”dawn phenomenon”
model in 2018 [122]. Another simulator named Glucosym
supports online simulations with 10 real patient profiles, used
for attack simulations and defence evaluations in [58].
Controller algorithms automatically calculate and adjust
insulin delivery to maintain the patient’s glucose level within a
target range. These algorithms can be integrated with patient
simulators to model and evaluate AID systems’ functional-
ity. Common control strategies include Proportional-Integral-
Derivative (PID) controllers, Model Predictive Controllers
(MPC), fuzzy logic controllers, and other nonlinear control
approaches. Notably, open-source algorithms such as Ope-
nAPS [123] enable T1D patients to connect commercial CGMs
and insulin pumps, creating a hybrid closed-loop system for
more automated self-management. A comprehensive review
of patient models and control strategies for AID systems is
provided in [124].
To further streamline simulation, some studies integrate
T1D patient simulators with controller algorithms to create
closed-loop AID systems testbeds. For example, LoopIn-
sightT1 [125] provides an in-browser simulation platform for
modelling closed-loop interactions between individuals with
T1D and AID systems. It integrates multiple physiological
models, such as the UVA/Padova [121] and the Cambridge
model [114], with several control algorithms, and offers in-
teractive visualisations to analyse diverse scenarios (e.g., the
impact of meal announcements). Zhou et al. [126] developed 2
closed-loop testbeds incorporating the UVA/Padova simulator
with Basal-Bolus controller and Glucosym simulator with
OpenAPS controller. They also provide a fault injection engine
and a labelled dataset of simulated faulty records. Another
available source is a MATLAB Simulink model testbed, which
simulates and integrates a continuous glucose monitor, an
insulin pump, and a PID controller [127]. These integrated
testbeds facilitate a more convenient and thorough evaluation
of AID security.
C. Real-world datasets
Real-world datasets are important resources for evaluating
the effectiveness of cyberattack defence systems. Although
they often lack explicit attack data, they are valuable for
assessing patient models and predictions, as well as the
performance of proposed security mechanisms in real world.
Several datasets provide rich data for continuous glucose
monitoring, both from free-living settings and clinical tri-
als. Datasets like JCHR-DCLP3 [128], REPLACE-BG [129],
D1NAMO [130], and OhioT1DM Dataset [131] provide CGM
data that could be utilised for experiments involving glucose
level prediction [94] [132] and re-identification [103]. JCHR-
DCLP3 dataset [128] was employed by Zhou et al. [126] to
test the performance of their proposed AID systems simulation
testbeds, while Elnawawy et al. [57] used the OhioT1DM
Dataset [131] to assess the impact of adversarial inputs on
machine learning model predictions.
In addition to glucose monitoring data, some datasets pro-
vide supplementary biometric and context information. For
example, the DICARDIA dataset [133] contains ECG data,
which Panda et al. [83] utilised to develop safety moni-
tors by analysing the correlation between ECG intervals and
blood glucose levels. The WUSTL-EHMS-2020 dataset [134],
though not diabetes-specific, offers network flow metrics and
biometric data, proving useful for evaluating defence systems
that monitor both biometrics and network anomalies, such as
detecting man-in-the-middle attacks by Judith et al. [100]. The
OpenHumans dataset [135], collected and shared by a diabetes
community, includes patient profiles, glucose levels, infusion
doses, and ample activity records. Additionally, AID systems-
faulty data, generated by the testbed described by Zhou et al.
[126], comprises synthetic data from closed-loop simulations,
including both safe and hazardous data traces from 20 patient
profiles, providing a useful source for evaluating fault detec-
tion and risk management.
VII. KEY FINDINGS
A. RQ1: What potential attack vectors and risks do AID
systems face?
As summarised in Table III, the attack vectors targeting AID
systems primarily threaten three core security dimensions:
confidentiality, by intercepting sensitive patient data; integrity,
by altering system data, commands, or logic; and availability,
by disrupting the normal functions.
Confidentiality attacks often utilise vulnerabilities in the
wireless communication links, such as weak or absent en-
cryption protocols, between system components, enabling ad-
versaries to eavesdrop using off-the-shelf radio interception
and generation devices. In some cases, such breaches may be
initiated by patients seeking greater visibility or control over
their treatment data. Availability attacks impair the system’s
ability to function properly. DoS attacks, for instance, can in-
terrupt the transmission of CGM readings and controller com-
mands or deplete system resources by continuously sending
malicious requests. These threats typically require moderate
technical knowledge—communication protocols and device
function—without necessitating a deep understanding of the
system’s control process.
As physiological closed-loop control systems, AID devices
are especially susceptible to integrity attacks, which can result
in incorrect insulin dosing within a short time frame. These
attacks may target any component in the loop, including
CGM readings, food registration, control algorithms, controller
commands, or the insulin pump driver. One of the relatively
direct forms is the replay attack, where previously intercepted
data is resent to the system. More advanced attacks involve
injecting crafted false values— such as randomly generated
or biased—to influence insulin delivery. These attacks require
reverse-engineering the communication protocol to produce
valid data packages [11] [51]. A particularly sophisticated
class of threats, known as process-aware attacks, involves
leveraging the knowledge of the system’s control process and
states to manipulate the system into a harmful but acceptable
state. Such as personalised insulin dose manipulation attacks
that only threaten target patients in a specific condition, and
ripple false data injection attacks that use minimal input per-
turbations to stealthily change the prediction of deep learning
models in the controller [56].
B. RQ2: How do existing defence mechanisms address these
risks?
Existing defence mechanisms proposed for AID systems
operate across multiple layers, as summarised in Table V,
targeting different stages of potential attack.
The first layer focuses on preventing wireless communica-
tion channels from interception and manipulation. Techniques
such as authentication, cryptography, and secure communi-
cation protocols are employed to protect wireless transmis-
sions between system components. Alternative communication
approaches, such as body-coupled communication or visible-
light communication, have also been proposed to minimise
exposure to in-the-air communication threats. In addition,
hardware-based measures, including wireless traffic monitors
or dedicated computation cores, can be integrated to protect
devices against availability attacks and ensure resilient com-
munication.
The second layer involves deploying intrusion detection
systems to identify breaches that may have already occurred.
These systems are designed to continuously monitor system
activity for signs of compromise by analysing signatures of
attacks, deviations from expected system operations, physio-
logical states, or control behaviour patterns. This layer plays a
crucial role in identifying emergent risks and enabling early-
stage mitigation before any harmful operations occur.
The third layer aims to assess control strategies. In cases
where attackers have successfully launched attacks to impact
insulin delivery, this layer serves as a final checkpoint to
identify hazards. It verifies whether the insulin delivery activity
aligns with predefined safety constraints or conforms to the
patient’s historical dosage patterns. By validating outputs at
the control level, this layer mitigates the risk of incorrect or
unsafe insulin administration.
An additional layer of protection involves redundant hard-
ware or software components that operate independently of
the main AID system. These auxiliary protections offer two
key benefits. First, they avoid placing additional strain on
the AID system’s internal resources, such as battery life,
memory, or processing capacity. Second, because they function
externally, they can be updated or patched more rapidly in
response to evolving threats without requiring full medical
device recertification. Examples include external monitoring
modules for inspecting communication traffic and system data,
or supplementary biosensors that provide physiological cross-
verification.
C. RQ3: How practical and robust are these solutions in
protecting AID systems from cybersecurity threats?
As outlined in Table IV, most known threats map to
corresponding defence strategies developed for AID systems.
Yet, their robustness and real-world applicability vary with
implementation constraints. The following discussion consid-
ers risks from primary categories to more nuanced threats,
together with the defence strategies and requirements for
practical deployment.
The most critical threats arise from weak wireless com-
munication protocols that lack robust encryption and authen-
tication, leaving systems vulnerable to eavesdropping and
manipulation of transmitted data and commands. Early AID
products’ protocol lacks encryption and authentication, and
multiple studies have demonstrated that they could be easily
compromised. More recent systems now incorporate crypto-
graphic and authentication mechanisms to protect wireless
communication; however, their robustness depends on the
strength of algorithms and key management practices. An
implementation challenge is that highly secure protocols de-
mand significant computational resources, which may impair
system performance and reduce battery life. To address this,
research has proposed adaptations such as reducing mes-
sage size, lowering communication frequency, or encrypting
critical modules (e.g., the controller) to increase security
without adding much computation overhead. Authentication
methods such as biometrics and hardware-based PUFs can be
incorporated to further protect critical controller commands
and biosignal transmissions from trusted sources. To defend
against availability threats such as DoS attacks, additional
hardware components—for example, dedicated traffic moni-
tors or separate computation cores—can be integrated. These
measures can be incrementally incorporated to strengthen ex-
isting wireless protections. While for highly security-sensitive
or fixed environments (e.g., in-hospital use), proximity-based
channels such as body-coupled communication or visible-light
communication offer promising alternatives to avoid over-the-
air exposure.
Even the strongest secure communication protocol can-
not guarantee complete protection. If adversaries manage
to compromise the closed-loop control process, monitoring
both physiological and system states becomes essential for
detecting integrity attacks and preventing hazards. Security
monitoring in current commercial products is relatively ba-
sic, relying primarily on threshold-based mechanisms to flag
extreme values for BG, insulin delivery dosage, and injection
rate. While effective at identifying attacks that cause extreme
deviations (e.g., delivering a maximum insulin dose) under
the assumption that monitored values are uncompromised,
these mechanisms fall short in addressing more subtle and
covert threats. For instance, replay attacks or targeted false
data injection attacks, which alter glucose readings or com-
mands within limits, may evade threshold-based detection.
Sequential change detection techniques can help identify dis-
continuities in BG readings. For attacks that craft gradual
changes, signature-based IDS can rapidly filter known attack
patterns, while specification-based IDS can validate controller
behaviour against system specifications to ensure compliance
with expected operation. Collectively, these defence strategies
are broadly applicable for effectively detecting many known
threats and activities that deviate markedly from normal device
operation.
More nuanced threats, such as process-aware and person-
alised attacks, can manipulate data in ways that cause targeted
harm without violating system specifications or matching
known attack patterns. Detecting such threats requires more
sensitive monitoring approaches that model the patient’s phys-
iological state and insulin delivery patterns. By identifying
deviations from an individual’s normal glucose or insulin
profiles, these potential attacks could be detected. Another
method is the use of multiple biometric sensors worn by
the patient, where correlations across signals (e.g., ECG and
BG measurements) are modelled to reveal anomalies. How-
ever, accurate modelling is difficult due to the inter-patient
variability and changing physical conditions. Insulin delivery
patterns also shift with context, lifestyle, and activity, meaning
that models based solely on historical data are prone to false
alarms once deployed. While advances in hardware, battery
efficiency, and tiny ML will enable more capable models in the
future, achieving a high-performance security monitor requires
online, continuous learning without catastrophic forgetting,
which remains an open challenge. Frequent offline retraining
and updating may mitigate this issue, but are subject to medical
device censor and unstable performance.
Importantly, although launching such attacks requires a
very high level of expertise for adversaries (i.e., break the
communication protocol and possess a deep understanding of
the control process and target patients’ unique characteristics),
these advanced monitoring functions offer dual benefits: not
only enhancing security by detecting data manipulations, but
also capable of identifying device degrading performance or
changes in patient physiological states. This dual capability
holds significant potential for strengthening medical device
reliability and enabling personalised healthcare (e.g., early
detection of disease), shedding light on the development of
future intelligent healthcare systems.
VIII. OPEN RESEARCH CHALLENGES AND FUTURE
DIRECTIONS
While the defence strategies discussed above potentially
offer multiple layers of protection and monitoring, their real-
world effectiveness depends on several critical factors that
must be addressed when developing a comprehensive security
framework for AID systems.
A. Overall Security
Although individual defence mechanisms target certain
threats at different layers, a robust AID system needs to miti-
gate a broad range of attacks while ensuring timely responses
to emergencies. This necessitates an integrated security ar-
chitecture that combines diverse protective measures into a
cohesive strategy. Key research directions include balancing
security strength with the computational overhead of combined
mechanisms and designing methods that complement one
another to reduce computation redundancy while enhancing
overall resilience.
B. Resource Constraints
As wearable medical devices, AID systems are constrained
by limited computational power, memory, and battery life,
which makes the deployment of resource-intensive secu-
rity mechanisms particularly challenging. While specification-
based and data-driven defences offer advanced security moni-
toring, implementing them without impacting device function-
ality remains an open problem. Future research should explore
model optimisation, computation offloading, and hardware
innovations to balance strong security with the operational
constraints of AID systems.
C. Variability Across Patients
For monitoring of system and physiological states, a major
challenge is distinguishing abnormal patterns from a patient’s
normal behaviour, which requires accounting for both intra-
and inter-patient variability. Each patient’s physiological re-
sponses, lifestyle, and treatment regimen are unique, making
it difficult to develop universal monitoring models that adapt
to these personalised characteristics. Future security monitors
for AID systems need to dynamically accommodate patient
heterogeneity while maintaining detection performance across
the device lifecycle.
D. Comprehensive Modelling of Insulin Infusion Patterns
Accurately predicting insulin needs remains a challenge,
particularly in response to dynamic contexts such as meal
intake, physical activity, and stress. Current insulin infusion
models struggle to account for the full range of variables
affecting glucose levels. There is a need for comprehensive
models that integrate multisource data to predict and adapt to
patient-specific insulin requirements. Improving the accuracy
of these models not only facilitates the development of fully
closed-loop insulin control systems but also plays a critical
role in defending against cyberattacks that manipulate injected
doses within insulin delivery systems.
E. Trustworthy Defense Mechanisms
While securing AID systems is essential, it is equally
important to ensure that defence mechanisms are reliable and
preserve patient privacy. Many recent data-driven cybersecu-
rity solutions operate as black boxes, providing little insight
into decision-making, which complicates interpretation and
intervention by users or healthcare professionals. Additionally,
sharing data between devices to improve model accuracy
introduces privacy concerns. Achieving effective knowledge
sharing without compromising sensitive patient information
remains a critical challenge, for which approaches such as
federated learning may offer promising solutions.
F. Standardisation of AID systems Cybersecurity Frameworks
Current medical device cybersecurity standards and guid-
ance leave the responsibility for comprehensive threat mod-
elling and protective measures implementation with manu-
facturers, creating a gap between broad regulatory compli-
ance and the satisfaction of the specific security needs of
medical devices. AID systems, as physiological closed-loop
medical wearables, face distinctive security and safety risks
that directly affect drug delivery in real-time. Addressing this
challenge requires complementary security frameworks that
specify existing and emerging threats faced by AID systems
and recommend appropriate countermeasures and emergency
responses to ensure system performance. Independent confor-
mity assessments are also needed to build confidence among
users and stakeholders. Ultimately, developing device-specific
security requirements and assessment mechanisms will be
essential for establishing more comprehensive and concrete
regulations for medical device security.
IX. CONCLUSION
This review provides a comprehensive analysis of the se-
curity landscape of AID systems, encompassing technical,
regulatory, and commercial aspects. We examined existing
attack vectors, defence mechanisms, and security assessment
approaches in the literature, alongside available research re-
sources. The priority of these threats and the practicality of
corresponding countermeasures were evaluated, highlighting
several critical challenges for future research. While sub-
stantial progress has been made, continued innovation and
practical implementation are needed to develop thorough,
resource-efficient, and patient-centric defence mechanisms.
Establishing effective security measures to prevent, detect, and
respond to threats in real time requires coordinated efforts
among researchers, manufacturers, regulators, and healthcare
providers. Successfully addressing these challenges is crucial
for enhancing system reliability, building user trust, and fully
realising the transformative potential of AID systems in im-
proving diabetes care.
