1. INTRODUCTION 
With the widespread rapid development of computers and the wireless communication, the 
mobile computing has already become the field of computer communications in high-profile 
link. Mobile Ad Hoc Network (MANET) is a completely wireless connectivity through the 
nodes constructed by the actions of the network, which usually has a dynamic shape and a 
limited bandwidth and other features, network members may be inside the laptop, Personal 
Digital Assistant (PDA), mobile phones, MP3 players, and digital cameras and so on. On the 
Internet, the original Mobility (mobility) is the term used to denote actions hosts roaming in a 
different domain; they can retain their own fixed IP address, without the need to constantly 
changing, which is Mobile IP technology. Mobile IP nodes in the main action is to deal with IP 
address management, by Home Agent and Foreign Agent to the Mobile Node to packet 
Tunnelling, the Routing and fixed networks are no different from the original; however, Ad Hoc 
Network to be provided by Mobility is a fully wireless, can be any mobile network 
infrastructure, without a base station, all the nodes can be any link, each node at the same time 
take Router work with the Mobile IP completely different levels of Mobility.  Early use of the 
military on the Mobile Packet Radio Networked  in fact can be considered the predecessor of 
MANET, with the IC technology advances, when the high-tech communication equipment, the 
size, weight continuously decreases, power consumption is getting low, Personal 
Communication System (Personal Communication System, PCS) concept evolved, from the

past few years the rapid popularization of mobile phones can be seen to communicate with 
others anytime, anywhere, get the latest information, or exchange the required information is no 
longer a dream, And we have gradually become an integral part of life.  Military purposes, as is 
often considerable danger in field environment, some of the major basic communication 
facilities, such as base stations, may not be available, in this case, different units, or if you want 
to communicate between the forces, we must rely on This cannot MANET network 
infrastructure limitations.  In emergency relief, the mountain search and rescue operations at 
sea, or even have any infrastructure can not be expected to comply with the topographical 
constraints and the pressure of time under the pressure, Ad Hoc Network completely wireless 
and can be any mobile feature is especially suited to disaster relief operations. When personal 
communication devices and more powerful, some assembly occasions, if you need to exchange 
large amounts of data, whether the transmission of computer files or applications that display. if 
we can link into a temporary network structure, then the data transmission will be more efficient 
without the need for large-scale projection equipment would not have point to point link 
equipment (such as network line or transmission line).  The current wireless LAN technology, 
Bluetooth is has attracted considerable attention as a development plan. Bluetooth's goal is to 
enable wireless devices to contact with each other, if the adding the design of Ad Hoc Network 
(MANET). 
 
 
2. RELATED BACKGROUND  
Nowadays, the information technology will be mainly based on wireless technology, the 
conventional mobile network and cellular are still, in some sense, limited by their need for 
infrastructure for instance based station, routers and so on. For the Mobile Ad Hoc Network, 
this final limitation is eliminated, and the Ad Hoc Network are the key in the evolution of 
wireless network and the Ad Hoc Network are typically composed of equal node which 
communication over wireless link without any central control. Although military tactical 
communication is still considered as the primary application for Ad Hoc Networks and 
commercial interest in this type of networks continues to grow. And all the applications such as 
rescue mission in time of natural disasters, law enforcement operation, and commercial as 
rescue and in the sensor network are few commercial examples, but in this time it’s become 
very important in our life and they become use it.  
The Ad Hoc Networking application is not new one and the original can be traced back to the 
Defence Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) Packet Radio Networking (PRNET) 
project in 1972[1, 2, 3] which evolved into the survivable adaptive radio networks (SURAN) 
program [4] .which was primarily inspired by the efficiency of the packet switching technology 
for instance the store/forward routing and then bandwidth sharing, it’s possible application in 
the mobile Ah Hoc Networks environments. as well as in the Packet Radio Networking devises 
like Repeaters and Routers and so on, were all mobile although mobility was so limited in that 
time, theses advanced protocol was consider good in the 1970s.after few years advance in Micro 
Electronics technology and it’s was possible to integrate all the nodes and also the network 
devices into a single unit Called Ad Hoc Nodes. And then the advance such as the flexibility, 
resilience also mobility and independence of fixed infrastructure, and in that time they so 
interesting to use it immediately among military battlefield, Ad hoc networks have played an 
important role in military applications and related research efforts, for example, the global 
mobile information systems (GloMo) program [5] and the near-term digital radio (NTDR) [6] 
program. And also has been the increase in the police, commercial sector and rescue agencies in 
use of such networks under disorganized environments.  
 
Ad Hoc network research stayed long time in the realm of the military. And in the middle of 
1990s with advice of commercial radio technology and the wireless became aware of the great 
advantages of Mobile Ad Hoc networks outside the military battlefield domain, and then

became so active research work on ad hoc network start in 1995 in the conference session of the 
Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) [7]. And then in 1996 this works had evolved into 
Mobile Ad Hoc Network, in that time focused to discussion cantered in military satellite 
network, wearable computer network and tactical network with specific concerns begin raised 
relative to adaptation of existing routing protocols to support IP network in dynamic 
environments, as well as they make the charter of the Mobile Ad Hoc Network Working Group 
(MANETWG) of the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) also the work inside the MANTs 
relies on other existing IETF standard such as Mobile IP and IP addressing  and most of the 
currently available solutions are not designed to scale to more than a few hundred nodes. 
Currently, the research in Mobile Ad Hoc Network became so active and vibrant area and the 
efforts this research community together with the current and future (MANET) enabling radio 
technology. 
 
Recently, the Ad Hoc Wireless Network and computing consortium was established with the 
aim to coalescing the interests and efforts to use it anywhere such as academic area and industry 
and so on. And in order to apply this technology to application ranging for the Home wireless to 
wide area peer to remote networking and communications. And it’s will certainly pave the way 
for commercially viable MANET networks and their new and exciting applications, which 
began to appear in all fields in this life. 
 
More recently, the computer has became spread significantly in the all the place and after a 
pervasive computing environment can be expected based on the recent progresses and advances 
in computing and communication technologies. Next generation of mobile communications will 
include both prestigious infrastructure wireless networks and novel infrastructureless mobile ad 
hoc networks (MANETs). 
 
3. WIRELESS AD HOC NETWORKS 
MANET is a collection of two or more devices or nodes or terminals with wireless 
communications and networking capability that communicate with each other without the aid of 
any centralized administrator also the wireless nodes that can dynamically form a network to 
exchange information without using any existing fixed network infrastructure. And it’s an 
autonomous system in which mobile hosts connected by wireless links are free to be 
dynamically and some time act as routers at the same time.  All nodes in a wireless ad hoc 
network act as a router and host as well as the network topology is in dynamically, because the 
connectivity between the nodes may vary with time due to some of the node departures and new 
node arrivals. The special features of Mobile Ad Hoc Network (MANET) bring this technology 
great opportunity together with severe challenges [8].All the nodes or devises responsible to 
organize themselves dynamically the communication between the each other and to provide the 
necessary network functionality in the absence of fixed infrastructure or we can call it ventral 
administration, It implies that maintenance, routing and management, etc. have to be done 
between all the nodes. This case Called Peer level Multi Hopping and that is the main building 
block for Ad Hoc Network. In the end, conclude that the Ad Hoc Nodes or devices are difficult 
and more complex than other wireless networks. Therefore, Ad Hoc Networks form sort of 
clusters to the effective implementation of such a complex process. In the following figure 1 
will shows some nodes forming ad hoc networks, and there are some nodes more randomly in 
different direction and different speeds.

In the past few years, the people became realized to use all the technology so widely and the 
people’s future living environments are emerging, based on information resource provided by 
the connections of different communication networks for clients also we have seen a rapid 
expansion in the field of Mobile Computing because  the proliferation not expensive, widely 
available wireless devices .A new small devices such as personal communication like cell 
phones, laptops, Personal Digital Assistants (PDAs),handhelds, and also there’s a lot of  
traditional home appliances such as a digital cameras, cooking ovens, washing machines, 
refrigerators and thermostats, with computing and communicating powers attached. Expand this 
area to became a fully pervasive and so widely. With all of this, the technologies must be 
formed the good and new standard of pervasive computing, that including the new standards, 
new tools, services, devices, protocols and a new architectures. 
 
As well as the people in this time, or the users of internet users in Ad Hoc network through 
increase in the use of its advantage is that not involve any connection link and the wiring needed 
to save space, and building low cost, and improve the use, and can be used in mobile phone, 
because of these advantage local wireless network architecture readily. And also beads in these 
advantages the wireless network can be used in the local area network terminal part of the 
wireless [9]. 
 
4. Wireless Mobile Approaches  
The past decade the Mobile Network is the only one much important computational techniques 
to support computing and widespread, also advances in both software techniques and the 
hardware techniques have resulted in mobile hosts and wireless networking common and 
miscellaneous. Now we will discuss about to distinct approaches very important to enabling 
Mobile wireless Network or IEEE 802.11 to make a communication between each other [10, 
11]. Firstly infrastructure wireless networks and secondly, infrastructureless wireless networks 
(Ad Hoc Networks) and we will clarify both in bottom.

4.1. Infrastructure Wireless Networks 
 
In this architecture that allow the wireless station to make a communication between each other, 
and this type relies on the third fixed party and we call it a Base Station, as shows in this figure 
2, and that will handover the offered traffic from the Station to another, the same entity will 
regulate or organize the allocation of radio resources. When a source node likes to communicate 
with a destination node, the former notifies the base station. At this point, the communicating 
nodes do not need to know anything about the route from one to another. All that matters is that 
the both the source and the destination nodes are within the transmission range for the Base 
Station and then if there’s any one  loses this condition, the communication will frustration or  
abort.

4.2 Infrastructureless Wireless Networks: 
The mobile wireless network As is well known a Ad Hoc Network MANETs, As has been 
previously defined in the Bidder is a collection of two or more devices or nodes or terminals 
with wireless communications and networking capability that communicate with each other 
without the aid of any centralized administrator also the wireless nodes that can dynamically 
form a network to exchange information without using any existing fixed network 
infrastructure. And it’s an autonomous system in which mobile hosts connected by wireless 
links are free to be dynamically and some time act as routers at the same time [12, 13].  the 
infrastructureless it’s important approaches in this technique to communication technology that 
supports truly pervasive computing widely duo to there’s a lot of  context information need to 
exchange between mobile units can not rely on the fixed network infrastructure, but in this time 
the communication wireless became develops very fast. 
In figure 3 we will see a small example for the Ad Hoc networks, to explain the work for the Ad 
Hoc network. 
 
 
Figure 3. Illustration of the infrastructureless networks (Ad Hoc Networks) 
 
This figure illustrates the modus operandi of Ad Hoc networks, there’s a three nodes Ad Hoc 
Network (S, A, L), the source node (S) need to make a communication with the destination node 
(L) and both of them (S, L) not in the same transmission range of each others, here both they 
must use the node (A)to send/ receive or forewords the Packets from source to the destination 
that means from node to another node.(R) is a node work as host and router in the same time . 
Also as we know the definition for the router is an entity that determines the path to be used in 
order to forward a packet towards its last destination. And then the router chooses the next node 
to which a packet should be forwarded according to its current understanding of the state of the 
network. 
 
5. Types of Ad hoc network 
The wireless Ad Hoc Network divided into two main types, firstly quasi-static Ad Hoc Network 
secondly, Mobile Ad Hoc Network (MANET). In the quasi-static Ad Hoc network the nodes 
may be portable or static, because the power controls and link failures, the resulting network 
topology may be so active. The Sensor Network is an example for the quasi-static Ad Hoc 
Network [14]. In the Mobile Ad Hoc network (MANET) here the entire network may be mobile 
and the nodes may move fast relative to each other. And now we will discuss both of them.

5.1 Mobile Ad Hoc Networking (MANET) 
Mobile Ad hoc Networking (MANET) is a group of independent network mobile devices that 
are connected over various wireless links. It is relatively working on a constrained bandwidth. 
The network topologies are dynamic and may vary from time to time. Each device must act as a 
router for transferring any traffic among each other. This network can operate by itself or 
incorporate into large area network (LAN). 
There are three types of MANET. It includes Vehicular Ad hoc Networks (VANETs), 
Intelligent Vehicular Ad hoc Networks (InVANETs) and Internet Based Mobile Ad hock 
Networks (iMANET). The set of application for MANETs can be ranged from small, static 
networks that are limited by power sources, to large-scale, mobile, highly dynamic networks. 
On top of that, the design of network protocols for these types of networks is face with 
multifaceted issue. Apart from of the application, MANETs need well-organized distributed 
algorithms to determine network organization, link scheduling, and routing. Conventional 
routing will not work in this distributed environment because this network topology can change 
at any point of time. Therefore, we need some sophisticated routing algorithms that take into 
consideration this important issue (mobile network topology) into account. While the shortest 
path (based on a given cost function) from a source to a destination in a static network is usually 
the optimal route, this idea is not easily far-reaching to MANETs. Some of the factors that have 
become the core issues in routing include variable wireless link quality, propagation path loss, 
fading, interference; power consumed, and network topological changes. This kind of condition 
is being provoked in a military environment because, beside these issues in routing, we also 
need to guarantee assets security, latency, reliability, protection against intentional jamming, 
and recovery from failure. Failing to abide to of any of these requirements may downgrade the 
performance and the dependability of the network. 
 
5.2 Mobile Ad Hoc Sensor Network 
A mobile ad-hoc sensor network follows a broader sequence of operational, and needs a less 
complex setup procedure compared to typical sensor networks, which communicate directly 
with the centralized controller. A mobile ad-hoc sensor or Hybrid Ad Hoc Network includes a 
number of sensor spreads in a large geographical area. Each sensor is proficient in handling 
mobile communication and has some level of intelligence to process signals and to transmit 
data. In order to support routed communications between two mobile nodes, the routing 
protocol determines the node connectivity and routes packets accordingly. This condition has 
makes a mobile ad-hoc sensor network highly flexible so that it can be deployed in almost all 
environments [15]. 
The Wireless ad-hoc sensor networks [16] are now getting in style to researchers. This is due to 
the new features of these networks were either unknown or at least not systematized in the past. 
There are many benefits of this network, it includes:  
 
 
• Use to build a large-scale networks  
 
• Implementing sophisticated protocols  
 
• Reduce the amount of communication (wireless) required to perform tasks by distributed 
and/or local precipitations. 
 
• Implementation of complex power saving modes of operation depending on the 
environment and the state of the network.  
 
 
With the above-mentioned advances in sensor network technology, functional applications of 
wireless sensor networks increasingly continue to surface. Examples include the replacement of 
existing detecting scheme for forest fires around the world. Using sensor networks, the detecting 
time can be reduced significantly. Secondly is the application in the large buildings that at 
present use various environmental sensors and complex control system to execute the wired 
sensor networks. In a mobile ad-hoc sensor networks, each host may be equipped with a variety

of sensors that can be organized to detect different local events. Besides, an ad-hoc sensor 
network requires a low setup and administration costs [16, 17, 18]. 
6. The Traffic Types in the Ad Hoc Networks 
The Traffic Types in the Ad Hoc Networks are so different from the infrastructure wireless 
network, and then now we will see these types. The first one Peer to Peer (P2P) the second 
remote to remote and lastly dynamic traffic. So now we will discuss every one [19]. 
Firstly, Peer to peer: communication between two nodes in the same area, that means which are 
within one hop. Network traffic (in bits per second) is usually fixed. Secondly, remote to 
remote: Communication between two nodes beyond a single hop, but maintain a stable route 
between them. This may be the result of a number of Nodes, to stay within the range of each 
other in one area or may move as a group. Movement it’s a similar to the standard network 
traffic. Finally, Dynamic traffic: its will happened when the nodes are movie dynamically 
around and then the routers must be reconstructed. This results in a poor connectivity and 
network activity in short bursts. For example in IEEE 802.11 network and the basic structure 
divided into two types firstly infrastructures wireless LAN, the second structure Ad Hoc 
Wireless LAN. 
 
6.1 Infrastructures Wireless LAN 
In this kind of network as we shows in the figure 4, the network in any architecture will be an 
access point; its function is one or more of the wireless local area network and the existing cable 
network systems to link, so that stations within the wireless local area network and external 
nodes can connect with each other. It is characterized by a fixed and pre-positioning a good base 
station location, the static backbone network topology, a good environment and a stable 
connection, the base station that is doing a good job when you set up detailed plans [60]. 
 
 
 
Figure 4. Infrastructure wireless LAN Architecture. 
 
6.2 Ad Hoc Wireless LAN 
That means it’s without or relies on infrastructures wireless local area network, which only 
targeted at local area network within the framework of each machine is able to be linked up into 
networks, regardless of whether the communication with the outside world, then such a 
structure, either one or two users can communicate directly with each other, and this structure is 
composed of at least composed of two or more workstations. Is characterized by no fixed base 
stations, network will be rapidly changing; dynamic network topology is vulnerable to 
interference, to automatically form a network without infrastructure and adapt to topology 
changes. For more explain shows the figure 5 for Ad Hoc Wireless network.

7. The fundamentals for the Mobile Ad Hoc Networks:   
According for example to IETF RFC 2501, MANET has characteristics can be divided into the 
following sections:   
7.1 Dynamic topologies: nodes can move freely, network topology may change rapidly, 
restructuring, but also may also have symmetric and asymmetric links.   
7.2 Bandwidth-constrained, variable capacity links Compared with the wired network 
environment, the capacity of the wireless link itself is relatively small, but also susceptible to 
external noise, interference, and signal attenuation effects.   
7.3 Energy-constrained operation A laptop or handheld computers are often used batteries to 
provide power, how to save electricity in the context of depletion of system design is also 
necessary to consider the point.   
7.4 Limited physical security Network Security With the network deeply embedded in our daily 
lives and the benefits have become increasingly important in the wireless network to provide 
security support is also an important issue.    
 
8. Ad Hoc Network Routing Protocol Performance Issues  
 
As the MANET with the traditional wired, fixed networks have many different characteristics, 
so to design a suitable routing protocol for MANET operating environment must also consider 
the different directions, the following sub-qualitative and quantitative aspects of the discussion:  
8.1 on the qualitative aspects, can be divided into   
8.1.1  Distribution operation: due to the existence of MANET where there is no prerequisite for 
the construction of the underlying network, so routing can not rely on a particular node to 
operate.   
8.1.2  Loop-freedom: all the routing protocol should be consistent with the characteristics; we 
must ensure the normal work in order to avoid waste of bandwidth.   
8.1.3  Demand-based operation: In order to reduce the burden on each node, if the link is not so 
much the demand should be considered when using On-demand approach to the establishment 
of the path, and only when the need for a particular path query, the establishment of the path.   
8.1.4  Proactive operation: with the On-demand concept of the contrary, if the network 
resources fairly adequate, proactive table-driven approach could speed up the path to the 
establishment of speed.   
8.1.5  Security: Because it is the wireless environment, to how to ensure the security of the 
connection can not be ignored will be part of network security is also a MANET from theory to 
implementation of the key challenges   
8.1.6  Sleep Period operation: As the MANET nodes are generally smaller wireless devices, 
using the battery as a power supply, how to save power consumption, or for no work, the node 


goes into sleep mode, can operate more smoothly so that MANET. Also the nodes of a Mobile 
Ad Hoc Networks may stop transmitting or receiving or both, also even receiving requires 
power for arbitrary time periods and the routing protocol should be able to accommodate such 
sleep periods without overly adverse consequences. This property may require close coupling 
with the link-layer protocol through a standardized interface.   
8.1.7  Unidirectional link support: MANET nodes have heterogeneous characteristics, and some 
may be notebook computers, and some may be PDA, and some might be even smaller devices, 
in this environment, the transmission characteristics of asymmetric more significant than the 
wired environment.   
8.2 On the quantity, can be divided into   
8.2.1 End-to-end data throughput and delay: data transmission rate and delay in the case that 
every routing protocol must take into account the focus should be how to find the best path? Is 
the maximum bandwidth or minimum latency, or the link to the most stable? Considered more 
likely to make more complicated routing protocol, but it is possible to significantly improve the 
transmission quality.   
8.2.2 Route Acquisition time: While the table-driven generally higher than on-demand 
performance good, but many of the former to pay the price, which, if properly designed, for 
example, there is more commonly used in the path cache, or a certain fixed path , can improve 
the path to the establishment of time.   
8.2.3 Percentage Out-of-order delivery: real-time data for this part of the more stringent 
requirements, and general information will not affect how and upper TCP cooperation is also IP 
routing work.  
8.2.4 Efficiency: the simplest method, the smallest control overhead done the most complete, 
most powerful feature is a common goal for all routing protocol.    
9. Types of Ad Hoc Protocols 
Ad Hoc Network routing protocols is divided to three type of routing protocols, which that 
depending on a different of routing protocols [20-26]. 
9.1 Oriented routing table (Table-driven) 
It is an active routing environment in which the intervals between the wireless nodes will send 
medical information with more paths.  Each wireless node is on the basis of information 
gathered recently to change its route table. When the network topology change makes the 
original path is invalid, or the establishment of any new path, all nodes will receive updates on 
the status path. The path will be continuously updated, so that the node in time of peace on its 
own routing tables is ready, and immediately available when needed. However, such 
agreements must be periodically to broadcast messages, so a considerable waste of wireless 
bandwidth and wireless node power, but if you want to reduce the broadcast bandwidth 
consumption caused by a large number, we should lengthen the interval between each broadcast 
time, which in turn will result in the path table does not accurately reflect network topology 
changes. 
9.2 Demand-driven (On-demand) 
When needed to send packets only it began to prepare to send the routing table. When a wireless 
node needs to send data to another wireless node, the source client node will call a path 
discovery process, and stored in the registers of this path. The path is not valid until the 
expiration or the occurrence of conditions of the agreement with the first phase of a ratio of such 
agreements in each node. A smaller amount of data needed, and do not need to save the entire 
network environment and the routing information. The main benefit of this agreement is that the 
use of a lower bandwidth, but the drawback is that not every wireless node that sends packets 
can always quickly find the path. The path discovery procedure can cause delays and the 
average delay time is longer [27].

 It is an improvement of the abovementioned two, or the combination of other equipment, such 
as global positioning system (GPS) and other equipment, participate in the study of mechanisms 
to facilitate the routing of the quick search, and data transmission.[28,29] 
However, there are already more than 13 kinds of the above routing protocol have been 
proposed, following the more representative for several separate presentations, and to compare 
their individual differences lie. And then we will discuss about everyone and we will show the 
way to works everyone works. 
 
10. 
The compare between Proactive versus Reactive and then Clustering and 
Hierarchical Routing 
 
10.1 Proactive versus Reactive Approaches  
Ad hoc routing protocols can be classified as into two types; proactive or On Demand (reactive) 
base on each own strategy [56]. Proactive protocols demand nodes in a wireless ad hoc network 
to keep track of routes to all possible destinations. This is important because, whenever a packet 
requests to be forwarded, the route is beforehand identified and can be used straight away. 
Whenever there’s modification in the topology, it will be disseminated throughout the entire 
network. Instances include “destination-sequenced distance-vector” (DSDV) routing [30], 
“wireless routing protocol” (WRP) [32], “global state routing” (GSR) [57], and “fisheye state 
routing” (FSR) [58] and in next section will discuss about everyone. 
On-demand (reactive) protocols will build the routes when required by the source node, in order 
for the network topology to be detected as needed (on-demand). When a node needs to send 
packets to several destinations but has no routes to the destination, it will start a route detection 
process within the network. When a route is recognized, it will be sustained by a route 
maintenance procedure until the destination becomes unreachable or till the route is not wanted 
anymore. Instances include “ad hoc on-demand distance vector routing” (AODV) [33], 
“dynamic source routing” (DSR) [37], and “Cluster Based Routing protocol” (CBRP) [59]. 
Proactive protocols comprise the benefit that new communications with arbitrary destinations 
experience minimal delay, but experience the disadvantage of the extra control overhead to 
update routing information at all nodes. To overcome with this limitation, reactive protocols 
take on the opposite method by tracking down route to a destination only when required. 
Reactive protocols regularly utilize less bandwidth compared to proactive protocols, however it 
is a time consuming process for any route tracking activity to a destination proceeding to the 
authentic communication. Whenever reactive routing protocols must relay route requests, it will 
create unnecessary traffic if route discovery is required regularly. 
10.2 Clustering and Hierarchical Routing 
Scalability is one of the major tribulations in ad hoc networking. The term scalability in ad hoc 
networks can be defined as the network’s capability to provide an acceptable level of service to 
packets even in the presence of a great number of nodes in the network. If the number of nodes 
in the network multiply for proactive routing protocols, the number of topology control 
messages will increases nonlinearly and it will use up a large fraction of the available 
bandwidth.  
While in reactive routing protocols, if there are a large numbers of route requests propagated to 
the entire network, it may eventually become packet broadcast storms. Normally, whenever the 
network size expands beyond certain thresholds, the computation and storage requirements 
become infeasible. At a time whenever mobility is being taken into consideration, the regularity 
of routing information updates may be extensively enhanced, and will deteriorate the scalability 
issues.

In order to overcome these obstacles and to generate scalable and resourceful solutions, the 
solution is to use hierarchical routing. Wireless hierarchical routing is based on the idea of 
systematizing nodes in groups and then assigns the nodes with different task within and outside 
a group. Both the routing table size and update packet size are decreased by comprising only a 
fraction of the network. For reactive protocols, restricting the scope of route request broadcasts 
can assists in improving the competency. The best method of building hierarchy is to gather all 
nodes geographically near to each other into groups. Every cluster has a principal node (cluster 
head) that corresponds with other nodes. Instances of hierarchical ad hoc routing protocols 
include “zone routing protocol” (ZRP) [46]. 
 
11. 
Existing Ad Hoc Protocols 
 
For the Ad Hoc network there are more than 13 kinds of the above routing protocol have been 
proposed, following the more representative for several separate presentation, and to compare 
between them, and for more dilates about existing ad hoc network protocols [62]. 
 
11.1 Destination-Sequenced Distance-Vector Routing (DSDV)  
 
Destination-Sequenced Distance-Vector Routing [30, 61] is based on traditional Bellman-Ford 
routing algorithms were developed by the improvement, and a routing table-based protocol.  
Each node in an operation must be stored a routing table, which records all the possible links 
with the nodes in the node and the distance like the number of hops, routing table within each 
record also contains a sequence number, which is used to determine are there any more old path 
in order to avoid routing table generation. DSDV is basically on the Internet Distance-Vector 
Routing the same, but more destination sequence number of the record, makes the Distance-
Vector Routing more in line with this dynamic network MANET needs, In addition, when 
network topology changes are less frequent when the routing table does not need to exchange all 
the information, DSDV, within each node, together with a table, is used to record the routing 
table changes from the last part of the exchange so far, if you change a lot of the conduct of all 
the information The exchange, known as the full dump packets, if the change very little, it is 
only for the part of the exchange, known as the incremental packet. 
 
11.2 Global State Routing (GSR) 
 
Global State Routing (GSR) [58] is almost the same as DSDV, because it has the idea of link 
state routing but it makes a progress by decreasing the flooding of routing messages. In this 
algorithm, each node maintains a neighbour list, a topology table, a next hop table and a 
distance table. 
•The neighbour list of a node includes the list of its neighbours (all nodes that can be heard by 
it). 
• The link state information for each destination is maintained in the topology table together 
with the timestamp of the information. 
• The next hop table includes the next hop to which the packets for each destination must be 
dispatched. 
• The distance table contains the shortest distance to each destination node. The routing 
messages will be created on a link change as in all link state protocols. Whenever it accepts a 
routing message, the node updates its topology table if the sequence number of the message is 
later than the sequence number stored in the table and it then reconstructs its routing table and 
broadcasts the information to its neighbours. 
 
11.3Cluster head Gateway Switch Routing (CGSR)  
 
Cluster head Gateway Switch Routing [31] is to build from the DSDV above a routing protocol, 
using a cluster head to manage a group of action nodes, that is, the action is divided into a group 


of a group of nodes, each elected by a head, the cluster head among through a gateway to 
connect to each other, into a hierarchical structure.  Whether a link between nodes within a 
cluster, or a link between each cluster head, are based on DSDV routing, so each node also 
needs a routing table for the record, in addition to DSDV need some information is also 
necessary to routing table with a record of all the other nodes and the corresponding cluster 
head. 
 
 
 
 
Figure 6. CGSR: routing from node 1 to node 8 
 
In the end web of which nodes should be selected as cluster head, and when the cluster head 
movement and also how to avoid future path changes significantly under to find a new head, all 
in real CGSR to allow for the more difficult areas. 
 
11.4 Wireless Routing Protocol (WRP) 
  
Wireless Routing Protocol [32] makes use of the routing table at each node in the record to 
complete the routing, and DSDV with CGSR difference is that, WRP require each node to 
operate a record four tables, namely Distance table, Routing table, Link-cost table, Message 
retransmission list table. WRP use the update message between adjacent nodes in each pass is 
used to determine whether the adjacent nodes to maintain their link relationship, and Message 
retransmission list (MRL) is used to update records which need to re-transmission, and which 
update needs acknowledgement.  WRP use of distance and the second-to-last hop information to 
find the path, such an approach can effectively improve the distance-vector routing possible 
count-to-infinity problem.  
 
11.5 Fisheye State Routing (FSR)  
Fisheye State Routing (FSR) [59] is an enhancement of GSR. The large size of update messages 
in GSR dissipates a substantial amount of network bandwidth. In order to overcome this 
problem, FSR will use a method where each updated messages would not includes information 
about all nodes. As an alternative, it swaps information about neighbouring nodes regularly than 
it does about farther nodes, thus reducing the update message size. In this way, each node gets 
accurate information about near neighbours and accuracy of information decreases as the 
distance from the node increases. Even though a node does not have accurate information about 
distant nodes, the packets are routed correctly because the route information becomes more and 
more accurate as the packet moves closer to the destination. 
11.6 Ad Hoc On-Demand Distance Vector Routing (AODV)  
 
Ad Hoc On-Demand Distance Vector Routing using distance-vector concept [33,34,35], but in 
several different ways and the above is that, AODV does not maintain a routing table, but when 
a node needs to communicate with another node on demand only to the approach to building 
routing table.  When a node wants to send data to another node in the network, the first to 
broadcast a Route Request (RREQ) packet [36], RREQ where the record that this is given by 
which a source is to be used to find which of a destination node. RREQ in the network is a kind 
of flooding of the transfer mode, destination until they were received, of course, a node can only 
be processed once on the same RREQ in order to avoid routing loop generation. In theory all the 
nodes between the source and the destination of the RREQ will be passing a temporary record 
will be on the last hop of the RREQ via Path of information, when the destination of the RREQ

As the RREP of passing along the nodes on this path will be a record of the relevant 
information, when the RREP was sent to a sent RREQ the source the beginning, this section of 
the path from source to destination even been established, and thereafter source can use this 
route to send packets to the destination. 
 
 
 
 
 
Figure 8. AODV: forward path formation 
 
It is noteworthy that, AODV and DSDV routing table inside the same have also recorded a 
destination sequence number, to avoid routing loop from occurring, but also to ensure the path 
recorded in the latest expression of the topology. 
11.7 Dynamic Source Routing (DSR) 
 
Dynamic Source Routing [37,38,39] As the name suggests is the use of the concept of source 
routing, the routing information that is directly recorded in the inside of each packet, but to be in 
the MANET environment, the use of such a special, DSR is needed only when the path to find 
out the path, that is, on -demand.

Figure 10. DSR: route reply 
Route Discovery with AODV is similar, but also broadcast from the source client to send a 
Route Request, the difference is, Route Request after one for each hop, this hop of the ID will 
be recorded in the Route Request a Route Record, the way, When the Route Request reaches 
destination, they will have all the nodes in the path of information, destination in many elected a 
Request where the best path, according to Route Record to send a Route Reply back to source, 
source will be recorded in the route reply stored inside the route record in the routing table, then 
all should be sent to the destination of the packet will have the route record on the inside, only 
the source path need to have this information, source and destination paths between other nodes 
in the packet as long as the view inside the route record and then forward you can go out 
without having to re-select the path.  
11.8 Temporally Ordered Routing Algorithm (TORA) 
  
Temporally Ordered Routing Algorithm [40, 41] (TORA). concept of link reversal will be used 
in MANETS become a kind of decentralized routing algorithms, from the beginning need to 
route the data sender to the destination number can be used to identify the direction of the path, 
suitable for highly dynamic environment. TORA is that when there is link the characteristics of 
the changes, produced by the adjacent node control message is confined to changes occurring at 
the vicinity of its operation is divided into three steps: Route Creation, Route Maintenance, 
Route Erasure. In general the process of establishing the route, the network where each node is 
assigned a "height", and to form a destination as the root of a directed acyclic graph (DAG), the 
adjacent nodes according to height, all the link will be was designated as upstream or 
downstream. When network topology changes, DAG was forced to re-establish, when to change 
the link to the upstream of the upstream node in the direction of height is responsible for the 
update, until the date back to the source, this update process can source that topology change, 
while not addressed to destruction of the other route. Topology change from the source to be 
updated at the beginning to the manner and distance vector routing prone to the same count-to-
infinity problems, but this is only a temporary instability.

11.9 Cluster Based Routing protocol (CBRP)  
 
 In Cluster Based Routing protocol (CBRP) [60], all the nodes are separated into clusters. In 
order to arrange the cluster, the following algorithm is used. When a node comes up, it will go 
into the "undecided" state and broadcasts a Hello message. When a cluster-head gets this hello 
message it will reacts with a triggered hello message immediately. When the undecided node 
gets this message it changes its state to "member". If the undecided node times out, then it will 
turn as a cluster-head. If it has a bi-directional link to some neighbour, otherwise it remains in 
undecided state and repeats the procedure all over again. Cluster-heads are changed as 
occasionally as possible. 
Each node maintains a neighbour table. For each neighbour, the neighbor table of a node 
contains the status of the link and the state of the neighbour (clusterhead or member). A cluster 
head maintains information about the members of its cluster and also maintains a cluster 
adjacency table that contains information about the neighboring clusters. For each neighbor 
cluster, the table has entry that contains the gateway through which the cluster can be reached 
and the information about the cluster head. When a source has to send data to destination, it 
floods route request packets (but only to the neighboring cluster-heads). While receiving the 
request, a cluster head will checks whether the destination is in its cluster. If yes, then it sends 
the request directly to the destination or it will send to all its adjacent cluster-heads. The cluster-
heads address is documented in the packet. Then a cluster-head will discards a request packet 
that has been detected. When the destination receives the request packet, it will reply with the 
route that had been recorded in the request packet. If the source does not receive a reply within a 
stipulated time period, it will backs off exponentially before trying to send out another route 
request. 
In CBRP, routing is done by using the source routing. It also uses the route shortening when 
receiving a source route packet. The node will attempt to find the farthest node in the route and 
sends the packet to that node and therefore reducing the route. In the process of transferring the 
packet, if a node detected a broken link, it will send back an error message to the source and 
then uses a local repair mechanism. In local repair mechanism, if a node detected that the next 
hop is inaccessible, it will investigate to see if the next hop can be reached through any of its 
neighbor. If any one of it works, the packet can be sent out over the repaired path. 
 
11.10 Associativity Based Routing (ABR)   
Associativity Based Routing [42, 43, 44] is primarily designed to focus on the MANET where 
links between nodes, unstable relations, and therefore uses the concept of associativity stability, 
is used to indicate a node relative to the adjacent node, link stability. ABR adjacent nodes on a 
regular basis by forming the beacon to indicate its presence, when a node n received from the 
adjacent nodes coming beacon, n will be updated on the associativity table, in which each 
adjacent node in the associativity table where the record is called associativity tick, said that the 
node relative to the n degree of stability.  The main objective of ABR is to provide the most 
stable path between nodes, the path establishment process is as follows:  When the node need to 
go the path of a node, broadcasting a BQ (broadcast query) message, the node will receive the 
query and its associativity table its own address on its neighboring nodes, together with the 
associativity ticks along with BQ continues to broadcast out, downstream node d will be its 
upstream node u where the information recorded in the BQ removed, leaving only, and d the 
associativity tick, that is, u, d, link stability. BQ way out radio, arrived at destination, it is 
already recorded on the path from the source to the destination of all associativity ticks, 
destination based on these information will be added to the total associativity ticks can be 
obtained respectively, the stability of each path, destination and so choose the most the 
appropriate path (most stable), and then along the path to the source terminal send REPLY, 
along the route through the nodes in its routing table information on the establishment of this 
path.  ABR also designed the path when the link failure, when the reconstruction method. When

Local Query (LQ [H]), is a restricted hop the number of BQ, which is the path to the 
reconstruction process in order to limit the topology near the approach to change, if one had not 
received within the time frame REPLY, u should send up Route Notification (RN), requirement 
of a node sending LQ [H], if not all the way up the success of the reconstruction path (not 
received from the destination of the REPLY), the midpoint of the path from source to 
destination is no longer the beginning LQ, but directly tell the source to re-BQ.

11.11 Signal Stability Routing (SSR)  
Signal Stability Routing and ABR also added a link to the consideration of stability, is divided 
into Dynamic Routing Protocol with Static Routing Protocol in two parts.  DRP and ABR, as 
the use of adjacent nodes in each other to define the beacon transmission links are stable, but the 
DRP only record is strong or weak, that is, a qualitative classification of links, rather than the 
ABR quantified associatively tick down the value.  SRP to use the information obtained by 
DRP, in the path to the establishment of the process, requires that each downstream node only in 
the Route request time from the strong link in order to continue broadcasting route request, 
select the first to reach the final destination of the request, along the source-side reply to 
establish a path, so SSR can establish a strong link in the shortest possible, and on the best path. 
11.12 Core-Extraction Distributed Ad hoc Routing algorithm (CEDAR) 
 
Core-Extraction Distributed Ad hoc Routing algorithm with the above in several different parts 
of routing protocol is the core use [45]. The original Core is used in the Core Based Tree (CBT), 
the used to indicate where one or more network nodes are given a special feature may be a relay 
point for all paths, or the management of certain special features exclusive, In CEDAR, 
MANET where some of the nodes have been selected for storage of local area link state, and is 
responsible for calculating the node within the region and select a path.

When the source (s) with a destination (d) create a link, first send a request to dom (s), that is, s 
region of the dominator, dom (s) the destination of the message broadcast out to build a dom (s )

such as bandwidth, making CEDAR become a Quality of service (QoS) routing; In addition, the 
definition of a group of network core, simplify the routing process, makes the web of the other 
nodes do not need to participating in a particular path routing. 
11.13 Zone Routing Protocol (ZRP)  
 
Zone Routing Protocol combines the path to the establishment of two kinds of reactive and 
proactive way [46] on the one hand enables the network to keep the record inside a node near 
the node routing information when a node wants to communicate with neighboring nodes in the 
path when you can get immediate information, but if you want to, and distant node links, only 
allow web of a small number of nodes involved in routing. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Figure 14. ZRP: a routing zone with radius = 2 (hops) 
 
ZRP defines a node n of neighbors within a hop distance of all the other nodes, as n, routing 
zone, since each node has its own different adjacent nodes, so ZRP, the entire Internet is in 
many overlapping routing zone. In the same zone where the routing is called intrazone routing, 
mainly using the same zone of nodes exchange distance vector, is a form of distance vector 
routing, but all the distance vector are limited to the size of the zone.

Bordercasting, if there is, you can reply, said that it has found the path can be connected to the 
destination. Such a process across a number of zone, so called interzone routing. 
And now we will shows the comparison between Table Driven, Demand Driven and Hybrid in 
Table 1, and then we show in table 2 the Table Driven for three kind of protocols such as WRP, 
CGSR, DSDV and comparison between them, Demand Driven (On-Demand) with six type of 
protocols such as TORA, DSR, AODV, ABR, CEDAR and SSR and comparison between them 
shows in table 3.

Quality of Service 
With the rapid development of Internet technology, when people for the Best effort service is no 
longer satisfied, how to get more bandwidth, how to reduce the mistakes, how to reduce the 
delay phenomenon, making Quality of Service (QoS) related research, including the Integrated 
Service (RSVP), Differentiated Service, etc., has become an important research topic. In the 
above-mentioned several agreements, most of them are made in the last two years, only for the 
basic mode of operation be defined, there is no consideration of QoS, only the ABR 
(Associativity Based Routing), SSR (Signal Stability Routing) and CEDAR (Core -Extracted 
Distributed Ad hoc Routing) and so there are three kinds of QoS-related functions.   
By ABR, for example, ABR defined by the concept of associativity is that QoS can be used to 
indicate a link between adjacent nodes stability, while the adjacent node in the exchange of 
messages, you can also Bandwidth, Delay and other conditions to join, this way then when you 
select a path, you can have more choices, but also can do according to the different applications 
of different considerations to select the most appropriate path may be to ensure a minimum 
bandwidth that can be used, or between two points of a finite delay. However, in the MANET, 
the network patterns change at any time, each node may change at any time position, that is, 
each node is the relationship with the adjacent node may change at any time, therefore, means 
that the need to provide QoS dependent on regular Beaconing, so that each node to master the 
situation around in order to provide effective QoS information. Beaconing make the overhead 
on the network increased, when the node mobility to improve even when the general 
information that may affect the transmission, which will be in the Ad Hoc Network to provide 
QoS, the biggest problem. 
 
13. 
Application in Ad hoc Networks 
There are a lot of potential applications applied on the Ad hoc networks and to support the Ad 
hoc Network Model to create a simple Ad Hoc Network, and that application such as the

European telecommunications standard institute (ETSI) also the HIPERLAN/2 standard[47,48], 
IEEE 802.11 wireless LAN standard family [49,50,51,52] and Bluetooth [53] the Ad Hoc 
Network are very important area in this time and very useful for the military (battlefield) and for 
the disasters (flood, fire and earthquake and so on),meetings or conventions in which people 
wish to quickly share information [54].and then use it in the emergency search-and-rescue 
operations, recovery, home networking ,as we will discuss that in the next table. 
Nowadays, Ad Hoc Network became so important in our circle life, because can be applied 
anywhere where there is little or without communication infrastructure or may be the existing 
infrastructure is expensive to use. Also the Ad Hoc Networking allows to nodes or devices to 
keep the connections to the network for as long as it’s easy to add and to remove to the end of 
the network. And there are a lot of varieties of applications for the Mobile Ad hoc Networks, 
ranging large scale such as Dynamic Network and Mobile and small fixed-constrained energy 
sources. As well as legacy applications that move from the traditional environment to the Ad 
Hoc infrastructure environments, a great deal of new services can and will be generated for the 
new environment, finally as the result the mobile Ad Hoc Network is the important technique 
for the future and to became for the fourth generation (4G), and the main goals for that to 
provide propagation the computer environments, that support the users to achieved the tasks to 
get the information and communicate at anytime, anyplace and from any nodes or devices[55]. 
And now we will present some of these practical applications as been arranged in table 5, and 
then we will discuss some of these application.

• Networks of visitors inside the airports. 
 
These are a lot of applications on Ad Hoc Networks as we saw in the last part and also in the 
table 5 provide an overview of present and future Mobile Ad Hoc Networks Applications. 
However, now we will discuss more about some of this Applications such as Tactical Networks 
(military battlefield), Home and enterprise Network (personal area network (PAN)) and  
13.1  Military battlefield. Military equipment currently is equipped with the state of the art 
computer equipment. Ad hoc networking help the military with the commonplace network 
technology to maintain information network between military personnel’s, vehicles, and 
military information head quarters. The basic techniques of ad hoc network originated from this 
field. 
13.2  Commercial sector. Ad hoc network can be applied in emergency or rescue operations 
for disaster relief efforts for example in fire, flood, or earthquake and so on. Emergency rescue 
operations will go to places where communications are impermissible. Therefore proper 
infrastructure and rapid deployment of a communication network is badly needed. Information 
is relayed from one rescue team member to another over a small handheld device. Other 
commercial application includes for instance ship to ship Ad Hoc Mobile communication and so 
on. 
13.3  Local level. Ad hoc networks can autonomously link immediate and temporary 
multimedia network by using notebook or palmtop computers to distribute and allocate 
information among conference or classroom participants. Besides, it can also be applied for 
home networks where devices can be link. Another example includes taxicab, sports stadium, 
boat and small aircraft. 
13.4 
Personal 
Area 
Network 
(PAN). 
Short-range 
MANET 
can 
simplify 
the 
intercommunication between a lot of mobile devices such as a PDA, a laptop, and a cellular 
phone and there are a lot of new devices in this for MANETs. Wired cables can easily be 
replaced with wireless connections.  Ad hoc network enhances the access to the Internet or other 
networks by means of Wireless LAN (WLAN), GPRS, and UMTS. The PAN is an upcoming 
application field of MANET for the future computing technology. 
 
14.  CONCLUSIONS 
In this paper we presented an exhaustive survey about the Mobile Ad Hoc Network (MANET) 
we distinct the characteristics of traditional wired networks, wireless ad hoc networks, wireless 
mobile approaches and types of ad hoc network as well as all the existing ad hoc protocols, and  
we comparison between the different papers, most of its conclusions pointed to a phenomenon, 
not a routing protocol can adapt to all environments, whether it is Table-Driven, On-Demand or 
a mixture of two kinds, are limited by the network characteristics; even though the same part of 
the Agreement On-Demand also due to the differences in the mode of operation applicable to
