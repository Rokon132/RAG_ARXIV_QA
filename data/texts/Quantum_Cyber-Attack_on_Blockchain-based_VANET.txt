Abstract—Blockchain-based 
Vehicular 
Ad-hoc 
Network 
(VANET) is widely considered a secure communication 
architecture for a connected transportation system. With the 
advent of quantum computing, there are concerns regarding the 
vulnerability of this architecture against attack algorithms 
implemented in a quantum computer. In this study, a potential 
threat is investigated in a blockchain-based VANET with an 
impersonation attack utilizing Shor’s algorithm implemented in a 
quantum computer. Specifically, the impersonation attack using 
Shor’s algorithm is created by compromising the Rivest-Shamir-
Adleman (RSA) encrypted digital signatures of VANET, and thus 
a threat to the trust-based blockchain scheme of VANET is 
successfully 
established. 
We 
implemented 
an 
integrated 
simulation platform combining OMNET++, vehicles-in-network 
simulation (VEINS), and simulation of urban mobility (SUMO) 
traffic simulator. In addition, we incorporated vehicle-to-
everything (V2X) communication in OMNET++ using the 
extended INET library. An impersonation attack on a blockchain-
based VANET is implemented using IBM Qiskit, which is an open-
source quantum software development kit. The findings reveal 
that an impersonation attack is feasible on the Blockchain-based 
VANET, which compromises the trust chain of a blockchain-based 
VANET. This research highlights the need for a quantum-secured 
blockchain for VANET.

I1. INTRODUCTION 
A. Background 
ECENTLY, blockchain-based Vehicular Ad-hoc 
Network 
(VANET) 
architectures 
have 
gained 
significant attention due to its distributed and 
decentralized architecture [1], providing efficient data 
transmission capability with secure data generation and 
broadcasting ability over VANET networks [2]. These 
architectures often employ rating-based or trust-value-based 
mechanisms, utilizing consensus mechanisms, such as proof-
of-work (PoW) 
and proof-of-stake (PoS), to ensure 
trustworthiness across a communication network [2]. Such a 
trust management system could ensure secure and privacy-
protected [1] vehicle-to-everything (V2X) communication 
because of its ability to maintain the veracity of the exchanged

messages via a digital signature of a message sender (e.g., 
vehicle). RSA (Rivest-Shamir-Adleman), a widely used public-
private asymmetric key cryptography technique, is commonly 
utilized in blockchain-based VANET architectures to encrypt 
messages. 
Given the low-latency data transmission requirements in 
VANET, minimizing delay in transmitting data packets is 
necessary 
for 
real-time 
vehicle-to-vehicle 
(V2V) 
communication. So, to satisfy communication latency 
requirements, a small key-based encryption is necessary, which 
is recommended and commonly used in VANET [3], [4]. Prior 
studies support the use of small key based encryption for 
blockchain security as it requires less complex computational 
operations and storage [5], [6].  
Given the limited computing resources of current quantum 
computers, this study demonstrates an impersonation attack on 
VANETs by scaling down the cryptographic standards (i.e., key 
size) of Blockchain. The findings highlight vulnerabilities 
under existing quantum resource constraints, proving the 
feasibility of an impersonation attack on Blockchain-based 
VANETs utilizing Shor’s algorithm implemented in a quantum 
computer. Furthermore, the results indicate that with sufficient 
quantum computing resources, the same attack scheme could 
compromise scaled-up cryptographic standards in Blockchain-
based VANETs.  
 
B. Potential Attack and Its Impact on Blockchain and VANET 
A classical attack model, such as a false message by any 
attacker, will cause a lack of trust in V2V communication, and 
a blockchain-based VANET can identify such malicious 
vehicles using a trust-based blockchain framework. However, 
there are cases where the trust-based framework of blockchain 
could become vulnerable. For example, a blockchain-based 
VANET cannot identify a malicious vehicle and corresponding 
false messages in an impersonation attack, as shown in Figure 
1. In this scenario, a group of vehicles, where each vehicle acts 
as an agent node [1], creates a blockchain under a Roadside Unit 
(RSU), and the RSU runs a trust management unit. All RSUs 
between each other form (as shown between #(N+1) to #(N+2) 
RSU) a trust evaluation chain, which is a chained framework to

store and transmit trust information. As presented in Figure 1, a 
malicious vehicle (orange in color) could impersonate a 
legitimate vehicle (green in color) by forging its digital 
signature using a quantum Shor’s algorithm. The attacker could 
generate an impersonation message (Message #1) of a false 
traffic crash and broadcast the false message to surrounding 
vehicles, as shown in Figure 1. All vehicles within its 
communication range, upon receiving the message (Message 
#1), send the acknowledgment (ACK) message (Message #2) 
to RSU #(N+1). RSU #(N+1) then disseminates the transaction 
message (Message #3) to other vehicles for their consensus 
regarding the transaction. After that, if it is an authenticated and 
trusted message through the consensus messages (Message #4) 
of the vehicles of this local network, RSU #(N+1) sends this 
authenticated false crash message (Message #5) to all other 
vehicles and RSUs within its communication range. In this 
scenario, RSU #(N+1) cannot find the malicious (original) 
sender (orange in color) of the false traffic crash message, as 
the digital signature of the legitimate (green) vehicle has been 
compromised by the malicious vehicle (orange in color). So, the 
trust mechanism fails to detect the attacker's vehicle. 
Furthermore, 
if 
the 
attacker’s 
vehicle 
receives 
the 
miner/validator capability—i.e., writing capability on the new 
blocks—as a legitimate vehicle, it also validates another 
malicious vehicle’s false message in the blockchain and can 
create a favorable scenario for the attacker. This scenario shows 
an example of the vulnerability of a blockchain-based VANET 
against an impersonation attack. 
 The impact of this type of attack on a blockchain-based 
Vehicular Ad-hoc Network (VANET) extends beyond merely 
disrupting; it can lead to severe consequences, such as roadway 
traffic crashes and significant congestion. Thus, false 
information about traffic incidents may misguide vehicles and 
traffic management systems and cause accidents or delays. 
Moreover, the compromise of the trust mechanism within the 
VANET's blockchain allows malicious actors to influence the 
operations of vehicles in a transportation network. This 
influence can lead to the validation of false transactions, 
including the introduction of fraudulent activities. The 
infiltration of false transactions undermines the reliability and 
integrity of the blockchain, eroding trust in the communication 
network's ability to accurately record and validate transactions. 
Consequently, the entire VANET ecosystem becomes 
vulnerable to manipulation and disruption, putting at risk its 
capacity to facilitate secure vehicular communication and 
coordination. 
 
C. Assumptions  
The vulnerability in the trust-based framework of blockchain 
arises in scenarios like impersonation attacks, where a 
malicious vehicle forges digital signatures of legitimate 
vehicles and compromises the trust mechanism in a vehicular 
network. Given the low latency communication requirements 
within a dynamic VANET environment, small key-based 
encryption is required. However, in this paper, the decision to 
use the small key size of cryptographic schemes within the 
blockchain technology is because of the current constraints of 
quantum computing. The study investigates the feasibility of an 
impersonation attack on a small key-based blockchain-based 
VANET and presents a proof-of-concept demonstrating the 
potential of an impersonation attack utilizing Shor’s algorithm 
implemented in a quantum computer. The experimental 
scenario is limited to four vehicles and one RSU to serve as 
Fig. 1. An example attack scenario for a Blockchain-based VANET.

proof of concept. The vehicles provide consensus, while the 
RSU acts solely as a local administrator without participating 
in the voting process. Thus, a constraint on vehicular network 
size does not impede the validity of the proof of concept, as it 
demonstrates the interoperability of the trust chain within 
VANET. This impersonation attack is not feasible with 
classical computing but becomes feasible with quantum 
computing. Therefore, if the encryption key size is increased, 
the same impersonation attack scheme would be feasible, 
provided there is sufficient quantum computing capability. 
These assumptions guide the objectives of the paper, which 
focus on analyzing blockchain vulnerabilities, developing a 
proof of concept for an impersonation attack utilizing Shor’s 
algorithm implemented in a quantum computer, and validating 
the impersonation attack model to assess potential threats in 
VANET architecture with the increasing power of quantum 
computers. 
 
D. Objectives and Contributions 
A blockchain-based architecture relies on two cryptographic 
mechanisms to provide security and trust [7]: (i) check the 
integrity of the data itself using hash functions, and (ii) check 
the ownership of the data with asymmetric cryptography. If an 
attack algorithm implemented in a quantum computer can 
compromise the cryptographic algorithm, it can create security 
concerns for any secure communication architectures, such as 
blockchain, as it uses an encryption technique (mostly on 
subgroup-finding algorithms utilizing factorization and discrete 
logarithm), i.e., RSA [8], elliptic curve digital signature 
algorithm (ECDSA) [3], [9]. In this paper, we developed an 
impersonation attack framework utilizing Shor’s algorithm, 
which was implemented in a quantum computer, and exploited 
the vulnerability of the cryptographic ownership mechanism. 
The objectives of this study are to: 
(a) analyze vulnerabilities of secured blockchain-based 
VANET,  
(b) develop and validate an impersonation attack model 
utilizing Shor’s algorithm implemented in a quantum 
computer to break the trust-based architecture of a 
blockchain-based VANET that uses asymmetric 
encryption, such as RSA and ECDSA.  
This proof-of-concept demonstrates a potential threat of 
attacks using quantum computers on the public-private key-
based cryptography in VANET architecture. Findings from this 
study indicate existing vulnerabilities of blockchain-based 
VANET architecture and provide insights into potential threats 
that could arise due to quantum computing advancements. 
 
II. LITERATURE REVIEW 
  For non-quantum-based attacks, prime factorization, 
which is a major part of cryptography used in ownership 
mechanism, cannot be broken in polynomial time [10]. Note 
that modular exponentiation is one of the necessary steps in 
prime factorization. However, modular exponentiation cannot 
be executed in polynomial time by classical computing 
algorithms, and it requires sub-exponential time[11]. Because 
of the superposition property of qubits, quantum computers can 
execute modular exponentiation in sub-exponential time. For 
example, it is possible to do factorization in polynomial time 
with a quantum computer, where a classical computer needs 
sub-exponential time to perform prime factorization [10]. Due 
to the nature of finding non-trivial factors in every iteration, 
Shor’s algorithm estimates and is more likely to find factors in 
a polynomial time [10].  
Quantum attacks can be formulated using two different 
algorithms implemented in a quantum computer: (i) Shor’s 
algorithm [10] because of its ability of factorization; and (ii) 
Grover’s algorithm due to its searching capability [12]. The 
Shor’s algorithm provides a threat on asymmetric cryptography 
through prime factorization and discrete logarithm problem-
solving capability, which covers the basis for a wide range of 
cryptographic techniques. On the other hand, Grover’s 
algorithm is applicable for symmetric cryptography through 
inversing the hash functions [13]. In this study, we have 
leveraged the efficacy of Shor’s algorithm for developing an 
impersonation attack scheme due to our focus on PoS based 
architecture and our impersonation attack. The Practical 
Byzantine Fault Tolerance (PBFT) [14], [15] one of the popular 
consensus algorithms for blockchain-based VANETs, could be 
vulnerable to quantum attacks. The PBFT relies on digital 
signatures and secure message exchanges to maintain trust and 
consensus in private or semi-decentralized networks. However, 
Shor's algorithm could pose a similar threat by compromising 
the authenticity of messages as presented in our paper. 
Grover’s algorithm is more appropriate for PoW-based 
scheme. The authors in [7] presented two primary applications 
of Grover’s algorithm. Firstly, the algorithm can enable 
quadratic speedup for solving hash functions and creating 
attacks [16]. The attacker, who controls more than half of 
network’s mining rate as miner, can monopolize the data and 
even rewrite the blocks by creating forks as well. Secondly, the 
attacker can search for hash collisions [16], [17] to replace 
certain parts of blocks without breaking the chain.  Moreover, 
the attacker can construct a more reliable chain by maintaining 
the hash pointer of the block identically, as the pointer of the 
previous block will then reference the same block. Currently, 
researchers explore the complexity of securing communications 
in VANETs, emphasizing the challenges posed by the highly 
dynamic and fast-paced nature of vehicle interactions. 
Traditional approaches, such as public key infrastructure (PKI) 
[18], and identity-based signature schemes[19], face issues 
related to certificate management, key escrow problems, and 
computational 
overhead. 
Various 
attempts, 
including 
certificateless public key cryptography (CL-PKC) [20], [21]and 
certificateless aggregate signature schemes (CLAS)[22], 
certificateless lattice-based schemes like CLLS[23], aim to 
address these challenges but encounter heavy computation 
power and communication latency. To enhance efficiency in 
CL-PKC, Mei et al. [22]presented a CLAS scheme, which relies 
on bilinear pairing and map-to-point hash functions, demanding 
resources beyond the capacity of onboard units (OBUs). In 
another study, Ali et al.[19] incorporated blockchain to enhance 
 
4 
 
revocation transparency, allowing participants to efficiently 
verify revoked pseudo-identities without relying on a trusted 
authority (TA). Despite this, their scheme's efficiency is 
compromised due to the necessity of a bilinear pairing during 
signature verification.  
On the other hand, attacks that do not utilize quantum 
computers, such as Sybil attacks[24], one can exploit 
weaknesses in cryptographic mechanisms that use bilinear 
pairings, such as identity-based encryption schemes [25]. Since 
bilinear pairings allow operations across different groups, an 
attacker can manipulate inputs to link multiple fake identities to 
a single key, tricking the network into recognizing multiple 
Sybil nodes as legitimate entities. To counter such threats, 
recent studies have proposed blockchain-driven authentication 
protocols that ensure secure data exchange between vehicles 
and infrastructure, mitigating risks associated with malicious 
activities. For example, handover authentication mechanisms in 
these protocols[26], [27], [28] use smart contracts to automate 
authentication during handover, ensuring trust without 
significant latency. Blockchain systems also facilitate key 
exchanges by assigning temporary identities to vehicles and 
periodically changing cryptographic keys, which enhances 
security against replay and impersonation attacks. However, all 
these studies rely on the complexity of cryptographic solutions 
and their inherent property of computational infeasibility, 
which ensures that adversaries cannot feasibly reverse-engineer 
keys or signatures without incurring prohibitive computational 
costs, thereby maintaining secure communication even in the 
presence of malicious actors. 
To ensure such secure communication, blockchains typically 
rely on robust digital signature methods for encryption, such as 
ECDSA, known for its strength but demanding considerable 
computational time. For instance, the Ethereum blockchain 
utilizes ECDSA, which takes nearly 10 milliseconds (ms) for a 
single signature and verification process [29], this would 
exponentially grow with aggregate signature schemes. To 
mitigate this delay, a lightweight encryption algorithm like 
RSA-1024 [30], [31] was employed, offering 80-bit security 
strength and requiring only one-third of the time compared to 
ECDSA-RSA-1024. The authors in[32] describe a transaction 
hijacking scenario in cryptocurrency platforms using the public 
key, which is published to the network or revealed from 
transactions sitting in the memory pools. They present an attack 
model that uses the Shor’s algorithm on a known public key to 
decrypt the private key. Then, using that decrypted private key 
creates a conflicting transaction spending the same value. They 
created a commit-delay-reveal architecture to safeguard the 
reveal of public key encryption. However, such a scheme can 
fail in a broadcasting scenario, such a delay will cause a lack of 
trust. Another limitation of the study was the failure to provide 
proof-of-concept and the effectiveness of such attacks with 
experiments or simulations. 
In another study [33], the authors explored vulnerabilities of 
five cryptocurrencies and their variations: Bitcoin, Ehereum, 
Litecoin, Monero and ZCash. Among these, Bitcoin exhibited 
vulnerability to duplicate transactions due to its signature 
scheme, while Ethereum faced potential replication issues with 
its consensus-based approach relying on digital logarithm-
based public keys. Similarly, Litecoin shared vulnerabilities 
with Bitcoin due to its analogous structure. Monero employed 
ECDSA and a bulletproof protocol to hide transaction amounts, 
while ZCash, which uses consensus-based scheme, utilized 
ECDSA. The focus was on assessing the susceptibility of these 
cryptocurrencies to quantum attacks targeting their signature 
schemes and consensus algorithms. The study revealed 
vulnerabilities against transaction forging and duplication 
attacks. 
While 
offering 
theoretical 
proof 
of 
the 
cryptocurrencies' vulnerability against algorithms like Shor’s 
and Grover’s, the authors do not provide experimental analysis 
to quantify these vulnerabilities with a comprehensive attack 
model. In contrast, the presented method in this study not only 
identifies vulnerabilities within blockchain and cryptocurrency-
based systems but also presents both comprehensive 
experimental analysis and an attack strategy against PoS-based 
blockchain schemes, along with a generic attack model 
applicable to PoW-based blockchains.  
The authors in [34] discussed attacks using quantum 
computers on Bitcoin and potential countermeasures to protect 
against them.  Their research specifically focuses on the impact 
of quantum attacks on Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. They 
examined the susceptibility of Bitcoin's PoW to quantum 
attacks, considering the public key disclosure through address 
reuse, along with the vulnerability of the cryptographic ECDSA 
algorithm employed in Bitcoin transactions. They found that 
while the current specialized application specific integrated 
circuit (ASIC) miners make the PoW relatively resistant to 
quantum speedup, the ECDSA signature scheme is more 
vulnerable and could be broken by a quantum computer as early 
as 2027. The study explores a detailed analysis of the time 
required for quantum computers to perform attacks on hash 
function using Grover’s algorithm and compares the estimated 
quantum computing power against the total hashing power of 
the Bitcoin network. It also explores alternative PoW schemes 
and reviews various post-quantum signature schemes as 
countermeasures. However, as this is theoretical proof of 
concept only, it lacks comprehensive analysis.  
 Existing literature lacks a practical attack model that uses 
quantum computers to test (without only theoretical analysis) 
against the traditional asymmetric cryptographic schemes and 
lightweight key structure feasible for dynamic VANET 
scenarios. This indicates the importance of this research and the 
gap in existing literature.  
 
III. BLOCKCHAIN-BASED VANET AND THREAT 
MODEL 
This section presents an architecture of blockchain-based 
VANET and identifies its vulnerabilities against an attack that 
uses quantum computers. 
 
A. Blockchain-based VANET Architecture  
The blockchain-based VANET architecture has not been 
standardized yet. However, two different mechanisms, i.e., 
5 
 
PoW and PoS based consensus [1], [2], are available in 
literature for implementing VANET architecture. Unlike PoW, 
which requires the computational power for solving 
cryptographic puzzles (i.e., solving SHA-X), PoS considers all 
the vehicles as stakeholders of the system, and trustworthy 
vehicles or randomly selected vehicles to be considered as the 
‘Miner’ criteria. In PoW and according to the consensus 
mechanism, a vehicle sends a traffic crash warning message, 
and it goes to the “Mempool” of the RSU/Miner. The Mempool 
is where the unauthenticated messages or transactions stay as 
long as there are no similar reports from other vehicles 
regarding the message [35].  On the other hand, the consensus 
mechanism of PoS checks the traffic crash message with other 
vehicles’ (stakeholders’) consensus/opinion about the message 
and finally validated by validators/miners. PoS can find 
malicious transaction through horizontal trust (HT) in V2V 
communication and vertical trust (VT) in V2I communication 
[36].  
The trust-chain is a trust-based blockchain architecture with 
asymmetric encryption to identify ownership using the digital 
signatures of the vehicles and their trust values, which increase 
with every authenticated transaction. A trust chain-based 
blockchain architecture verifies authenticity in two steps. 
Firstly, it verifies the ownership of the digital signature that is 
encrypted with RSA/ECDSA. Secondly, it checks the 
authenticity of the message using the consensus mechanism. As 
presented below in Table I, system configuration can be defined 
from 
the 
enrollment, 
transaction 
handling, 
consensus 
mechanism, storing the authentic request to blockchain record, 
miner/validator selection, trust value calculations and blocking 
of malicious vehicles after some transactions, which act as fault 
tolerance threshold. Based on the above definitions, attacks can 
be defended through authentication, transparency and non-
repudiation nature of blockchain networks. For example, a 
vehicle with vehicle ego-motion information with false 
trajectories (e.g., speed-difference and distance), false digital 
signature, or false information about a traffic crash can be 
identified using a consensus mechanism. 
 
B. Threats and Vulnerabilities of a Blockchain-based VANET 
The threats to a blockchain-based VANET system can be 
considered low if the trustworthiness of the system is 
maintained. Tempering of data and sniffing in ongoing VANET 
conversations (V2V and/or V2I) are considered less possible 
because of trustworthy encryption, such as RSA, hashing of the 
data, and distributed transparent ledger. However, the digital 
signature of a vehicle, which is part of each disseminated 
message, can be used to create an attack algorithm that uses 
quantum computers and makes a trust-based system vulnerable 
and can have a catastrophic impact on VANET, even creating 
the possibility of multi-vehicle collisions and changing the 
routes of vehicles. As illustrated in Figure 1, a general attack 
scenario on the PoS mechanism is presented, where a malicious 
vehicle generates a false message. Through the blockchain's 
consensus mechanism, the malicious activity is detected, 
tracked, and ultimately blocked. Then, a digital signature from 
disseminated packets of RSU is used to forge the digital 
signature of a legitimate vehicle. 
TABLE I 
COMPONENTS AND THEIR CORRESPONDING FUNCTIONALITIES 
FOR BLOCKCHAIN BASED VANET 
System architecture 
components 
Description 
Enrollment to the 
blockchain network 
System interactions with blockchain network is 
initialized by all the agent nodes (vehicles as 
moving nodes and RSU’s act as static nodes) 
downloading 
and 
updating 
following 
the 
architecture presented in [37] and the blockchain 
as a module (as Certificate Authority based 
authentication is not needed for PoS based 
architecture) with digital signature generated by 
RSU. Current blockchain transaction history has 
also been downloaded with respective trust values 
when a new vehicle joins the architecture 
Transaction 
handling 
There is a forward dissemination of packets from 
RSU (local administrator) to all vehicles within its 
wireless communication coverage to let every 
other vehicle know about any transactions and 
corresponding trust values to vote for the 
transaction authenticity. 
Consensus 
mechanism 
Voting is conducted by horizontal trust result 
(trusted=1 and not trusted=0) created by every 
transaction, which is sent to RSU (as VT step) for 
consensus. RSU calculates majority voting 
(greater than the threshold trust value) for every 
transaction and classifies malicious transactions. 
This threshold changes with increasing trust of the 
vehicles. 
Blockchain record 
Verified transactions with the approval of 
stakeholders are stored in the blockchain as a new 
block by the validator and dissipated to every 
agent node to maintain transparency in local 
blockchain module. 
Miner/validator 
selection 
To 
generate 
a 
block, 
entities 
called 
miners/validators (special agent nodes) with high 
trust value verifies in accordance with RSU’s trust 
result, writes verified data to new block of 
blockchain in accordance to defined rule 
(threshold in voting or trust value calculation) 
through smart contracts. A vehicle with the 
highest trust value (the highest stake value) or a 
randomly selected vehicle (if many vehicles have 
the same trust value) serves as a validator/miner in 
PoS. 
Trust value 
calculation 
This trust value offset has been calculated as 
described in the reference [2]. Trust value can be 
increased with every vehicle authenticity check 
and message validation (adds 5 per transaction in 
this paper), with identifying false transactions 
(adds 10 per transaction), and with adding new 
validators/miners (20 for mining) upon writing 
onto the block. If a malicious vehicle tries to do 
double spending with the same gas value (i.e., 
compensation value for a transaction to store in a 
block), it can be identified too. 
Block malicious 
vehicle 
The RSU blocks the malicious vehicle after a 
threshold of transactions. Trust values are carried 
to other RSUs, and if a vehicle is blocked by any 
RSU, it cannot enter a new block of other RSUs. 
 
6 
 
A malicious vehicle creates an impersonation attack by 
broadcasting a false message of a traffic crash with the forged 
digital signature. The system tries to block malicious vehicle 
identification through the digital signature with the majority 
votes of the stakeholders. In this way, a blockchain-based 
VANET blocks a “legitimate” vehicle as a malicious vehicle. 
So, with quantum computers [20], if we can figure out and 
break the encryption, such an attack would be possible [38]. An 
attacker gains the trust of the system, gets miner 
responsibilities, and verifies malicious transactions as authentic 
messages. Thus, the consensus of majority voting fails to 
remove the malicious vehicle as it has more stakes in the system 
by adding and verifying malicious vehicles as legitimate 
vehicles (increasing trust values) and using their votes to 
influence the system. The attacker starts double spending the 
initial gas amount at the beginning and spams the VANET with 
more false messages. 
The PoW mechanism also acts on the consensus mechanism 
using the consensus mechanism in an unauthenticated 
Mempool [35]. A malicious vehicle can report the same traffic 
crash with other vehicles’ digital signatures and authenticate the 
message. An attacker could have 10 minutes to either figure out 
how to crack the puzzle to act as a miner using Grover’s 
algorithm [29] or the digital signature using Shor’s algorithm 
utilizing quantum computers of other vehicles to spread the 
traffic crash notification from the Mempool. 
 
IV. IMPERSONATION ATTACK SCHEME  
Our attempt to breach the blockchain’s trust mechanism 
originates from the vulnerabilities associated with asymmetric 
cryptography, or public-key cryptography method. In 
asymmetric cryptography, a sender employs their private key 
(SK) to sign a transaction intended for recording on the 
blockchain, generating a digital signature. Subsequently, the 
sender broadcasts the transaction along with their public key 
(PK). The public key serves as a means for receiving nodes to 
validate that the digital signature originates from the rightful 
person. Asymmetric cryptography relies on either prime 
number factorization or the discrete logarithm problem to 
generate these key pairs. If one can break this algorithm with 
Shor’s algorithm, it is possible to forge the private key and 
hence forge the digital signature. With the forged private key or 
digital signature, a sender (i.e., a malicious vehicle) broadcasts 
false messages or transactions to other legitimate vehicles and 
corresponding RSU within its communication range in the 
blockchain. These private-public key pairs are formed using the 
prime factorization in RSA. By using Shor’s algorithm 
implemented in a quantum computer, a malicious vehicle can 
guess the prime factor and figure out the private key, thus 
forming the attack scheme.  
This section presents an attack scheme that will be used to 
launch an impersonation attack using Shor’s algorithm 
implemented in a quantum computer on a blockchain-based 
VANET. In this scheme, the trust chain's dependency on the 
corresponding trust value is exploited to detect any discrepancy 
by verifying the digital signatures and messages. Figure 2 
presents an impersonation attack scheme against trust-based 
architectures using quantum Shor’s algorithm, which is a sub-
process to forge the digital signature and use it to broadcast a 
false message (e.g., traffic crash) with a forged digital signature. 
An attacker checks if the system is PoW-based architecture or 
not, as it must decide if there is a time constraint (key refresh 
time and block interval) for the attack to be successful. An 
attacker with a forged digital signature sends out false messages 
and gains trust by pinning its blame on legitimate vehicles using 
their forged digital signatures. As a malicious vehicle takes on 
the miners’/validators’ responsibilities, it will improve the trust 
values of new malicious vehicles and help to get a majority in 
voting. A double-spending attack happens when it sends 
multiple transactions with the same gas value to save up its 
transaction limits (see Table I for more details).  
 
 
Fig. 2. Impersonation attack scheme using Shor’s algorithm implemented in a 
quantum computer for blockchain-based VANET. 
 
As a subprocess, Shor’s algorithm implemented uses period 
finding (phase) in superposition states to perform modular 
exponentiation in polynomial time (see Figure 2) to break RSA. 
Note that Shor's algorithm uses the Quantum Fourier Transform 
(QFT) to find the period of a modular multiplication function 
efficiently. The modular multiplication function takes two 
integers, say m and x, and computes the remainder of the 
product of m and x divided by some modulus, N. In other words, 
it computes  𝑚𝑥 𝑚𝑜𝑑 𝑁. To factor a composite number N using 
Shor's algorithm, we first choose a random prime number m 
between 1 and N-1. Then we apply the modular multiplication 
function repeatedly to compute 𝑚𝑥  mod N for a series of values 
of x until we find two values of x, say 𝑥1 and 𝑥2,   such that 
(𝑚𝑥1 mod N) = (𝑚𝑥2mod N).

multiplication function is then given by the difference between 
𝑥1 and 𝑥2,   i.e., p = 𝑥1-𝑥2. Finding the period, p, is the key step 
in Shor's algorithm, and it can be done efficiently using QFT. 
The QFT is a quantum version of the classical Fourier 
transform, which is a mathematical tool for analyzing periodic 
functions. By applying the QFT on the superposition states 
corresponding to the outputs of the modular multiplication 
function, the algorithm can find the period [23]. If the phase is 
odd or check 𝑚

(mod N, where N is a public key), it is in the order of r/2 (r is a 
fraction 
denominator). 
Then, 
the 
𝐺𝐶𝐷(𝑚(𝑟

prime factors of N. 
 
V. EXPERIMENTAL SETUP AND IMPLEMENTATION 
In order to validate the effectiveness of the impersonation 
attack using Shor’s algorithm implemented in a quantum 
computer, the performance evaluations of a blockchain-based 
VANET are conducted utilizing a simulation platform, i.e., 
Objective Modular Network Testbed in C++ (OMNET++) [36], 
[40]. 
 
A. VANET Setup 
For implementing this simulation platform, the simulation 
environment is divided into three modules: mobility, VANET, 
and quantum computing, as shown in Figure 3. To set up the 
mobility module, we used Simulation for Urban Mobility 
(SUMO) [41], which interacts with VEINS [42] and contains 
the road network and vehicle trajectory information. Overall, 
we simulated blockchain-based VANET using OMNET++, 
extended INET [43] library for V2V and V2I communication, 
as well as VEINS and SUMO for vehicular mobility. VANET 
has been tested and implemented using OMNET++ 5.6.2 
version with the help of SUMO.      
 
 
Fig. 3. Block diagram of system interaction architecture.  
  
The VEINS (5.21 version)-SUMO integration has been done 
to set up the simulation of a traffic crash scenario. INET 
(version 4) is used to implement V2RSU (V2I) and V2V 
communication. Our experimental scenario is limited to four 
vehicles and a RSU to serve as proof of concept. In this setup, 
the attack propagates throughout the entire simulation due to 
the interoperability of the trust chain facilitated by message 
passing through a RSU. The vehicles provide consensus, while 
the RSU acts solely as a local administrator without 
participating in the voting process. Therefore, this constraint on 
network size does not impede the validity of the proof of 
concept. We implement the blockchain using C++ in 
OMNET++ with five nodes, where four moving nodes act as 
vehicles and one static node, i.e., RSU. In the omnetpp.ini file, 
we declare the simulation conditions, initial money, data rate, 
connectivity protocols, delays, number of malicious vehicles, 
and number of malicious transactions (acts as fault-tolerance 
limit, considered two in our simulation). In the network (.ned) 
file, we declare all the V2V and V2I communication protocols. 
In the vehicle files (vehicles and RSU), we define the message 
relay, packet generation (packet length, packet type, digital 
signatures, 
timestamp, 
hashed 
messages), 
receive, 
acknowledgment, block creation request, verification, and 
routing information. The success of the trust chain depends on 
successfully decrypting, validating, and verifying authenticated 
messages and finding malicious transactions and suspected 
vehicles at any point in time. We generate log messages 
(timestamp and trust value) for every transaction within the 
blockchain-based VANET. The RSU aggregates the voting of 
every vehicle to make malicious vehicle identification decisions 
as per the consensus mechanism.  
As illustrated in Figure 4, after downloading the blockchain 
module and joining the network, every vehicle’s onboard unit 
(OBU) has three modules: mobility, VANET, and local 
blockchain ledger. The mobility module consists of the 
roadway network and the vehicle’s trajectory information. The 
VANET module enables V2V and V2I communication. The 
blockchain ledger module consists of records of transactions 
that contain a digital signature, a message, a timestamp, and 
transaction value details. Each vehicle uses the blockchain 
ledger module to send votes for each transaction. The RSU has 
the VANET module as it receives messages and disseminates 
transaction messages. It also contains a ledger module, which 
checks authenticity using majority voting, and maintains a list 
of suspected vehicles and their corresponding block lists. 
We use VEINS and SUMO to generate vehicle trajectory 
information. A dedicated ledger module is coded in 
OMNET++, and INET is used for VANET communication. For 
each message, a sender (a vehicle or an RSU) generates a 
packet, encrypts it with RSA using an asymmetric key, and 
broadcasts it to a receiver (a vehicle or a RSU). This 
communication between a sender and a receiver will be stored 
in their respective ledgers. This ledger information consists of 
their transaction value, which is a gas value as defined above, 
their digital signature, message, and timestamp. If both sender 
and receiver are vehicles, these transaction details are also sent 
to the RSU by the receiver, and the RSU disseminates this 
transaction to other vehicles to maintain consistency in the 
ledgers of other vehicles. Each vehicle generates the 
creditability of this transaction and uploads its trust value using 
either “1” or “0.” Here, “1” represents a trusted transaction, and 
“0” represents a non-trusted transaction.

The RSU then checks the transaction’s digital signature and 
corresponding gas value for double spending scenarios. In 
addition, the RSU checks the overall authenticity of the 
transaction, and the corresponding message based on majority 
voting. The trustworthiness of each transaction is decided based 
on a trust threshold value. If trusted, it increases the trust value 
of the overall system; otherwise, it puts the vehicle on a 
suspected list. At least two transactions are needed to identify a 
malicious vehicle as fault tolerance, block it, and pass it to other 
RSUs. The transaction value (or gas spent in every transaction) 
and trust value are calculated. The key parameters related to 
Shor’s algorithm-based attack model are provided in Table II.

B. Blockchain Setup 
Incorporating the trust chain architecture into OMNET++, 
the system features a non-blocking transaction system designed 
for efficient communication among agents, supporting multiple 
simultaneous transactions. Each agent owns and maintains their 
data, establishing local trust levels for scalability and stable 
performance. Every transaction creates a new block 
encompassing transaction data, previous block information, 
sequence numbers, public keys, and digital signatures. Initiated 
by the genesis block, the ledger progresses with subsequent 
blocks and agreed-upon transactions (using the consensus 
mechanism), ensuring transparency and security in a 
decentralized network. 
In a network of five nodes, including one static RSU and four 
vehicle nodes, trust-chain facilitates transactions through four 
operations in each vehicle: (i) transaction request (TR), (ii) 
chain request (CR), (iii) chain replay message (CRM), and (iv) 
transaction confirmation (TC); and four operations in each 
RSU: (i) transaction verification (TV), (ii) dissemination (DM), 
(iii) chain verification (CV) and (iv) chain confirmation (CC). 
The initialization step sets up parameters, initializes structures, 
and registers signals for logging. Incoming messages initiated 
by each vehicle go through the transaction request (TR) 
process. Then, the messages are processed by RSU with the 
transaction handling, taking various actions such as transaction 
verification (TV), dissemination (DM), chain verification (CV) 
and chain confirmation (CC) based on message types like 
transaction or chain requests.  
To ensure blockchain integrity, local and global logs are 
maintained in the log database, preventing duplicate entries.  
The RSU validates received transaction information against the 
global chain, and the vehicle checks its validity or duplicity 
against the local chain. The RSU oversees the successful 
dissemination 
of 
messages 
to 
vehicles 
through 
acknowledgement. At the TV step, the RSU checks 
authentication of messages. The system fortifies against 
malicious nodes through various functionalities, including 
randomized hashed addresses in the CR process, verification of 
digital signature in TV, and setting up public-private keys in 
initiation. With the voting phase in TC, the local and global trust 
levels are calculated, determining the threat levels of nodes. To 
ensure a message doesn’t sit on the unprocessed transactions 
indefinitely, the chain records the start and end timings of 
transactions and discards the request after 10 minutes. Note that 
the simulation stops if malicious transactions by an entity 
(vehicle or RSU) exceed a threshold number of malicious 
transactions.

Trust-chain’s gas values, equivalent to the concept of 
transaction fees in Ethereum (ETH), are dynamically calculated 
based on the complexity and resources required for 
transactions. Unlike Ethereum's fixed gas fees, trust-chain 
employs a flexible gas pricing model that adjusts based on 
network demand and computational intensity. This approach 
ensures cost-efficient transactions while accommodating 
varying computational loads. In this simulation, we considered 
a gas value of 100 ETH. Since an Ethereum transaction 
typically consumes 21,000 units of gas and the base fee is 
established at 10 gwei (a smaller unit of Ether), the calculation 
for gas per transaction amounts to (21,000 * 10) = 210,000 gwei 
[transaction fee = (gas unit * (base fee per gas + max priority 
fee per gas)] as per [44], which is equivalent to 0.00021 ETH. 
The maximum priority fee is assumed to be 0 for this scenario.   
As a result, this simulation has the capacity to accommodate a 
number of transactions within the specified fee parameters to 
accommodate this simulation. The adversary detection model 
assumes any node may be malicious, with trust-chain tested 
under adversarial conditions involving false message injection 
and double-spending attacks at intervals to evaluate 
performance. 
 
C. Quantum Computing Environment Setup 
In our quantum simulation, we employ a small key RSA-
based message encryption implemented in the Qiskit software 
development kit (SDK), which is part of the IBM Quantum 
environment [35]. RSA-based encryption utilizes prime 
factorization through Shor's algorithm to forge digital 
signatures of neighboring vehicles. The quantum Shor’s 
algorithm is applied to decipher the digital signature of the 
sender, allowing the generation of false messages with forged 
digital signatures for creating an impersonation attack within 
the VANET. The IBM Quantum Lab [24] is utilized for 
conducting this simulation experiment.  
For our experiment, we used the quantum simulator (Aer 
Simulator) to execute the circuit on IBM’s actual quantum 
architecture. The factorization relies on the Quantum Phase 
Estimation (QPE) algorithm, which iteratively determines the 
phase, which is then converted into a fraction to deduce the 
period r. Based on r, it calculates potential factors of N using 
guesses and validates them. Initially, Hadamard gates are 
applied to initialize the qubits into a state of superposition. 
Subsequently, controlled unitary operations are used to execute 
modular exponentiation 
The QFT is then applied to the qubits to extract the phase. 
Upon extracting the phase, the inverse QFT operation is 
performed using a combination of Hadamard gates and 
controlled phase rotation gates. Once these operations are 
completed, the quantum circuit is compiled into a basis gate set 
suitable for simulation on quantum hardware. The circuit is then 
executed using a quantum simulator, specifically the 
AerSimulator.  
Utilizing the Qiskit SDK, we can efficiently determine the 
co-prime of a small prime number (15) capable of encrypting 
any number between 0 and 9 as a digital signature. Moreover, 
it can encrypt up to any of 14 sequential letters out of the 26 
alphabets in English, serving as messages in V2V 
communications. This capability allows us to break the small 
key RSA algorithm using Shor’s algorithm. Subsequently, we 
generate messages with forged digital signatures from a vehicle 
chosen as the malicious entity in our simulation. The quantum 
attack compromises the entire trust mechanism of the 
blockchain, as it incorrectly identifies another vehicle as 
malicious while failing to pinpoint the original malicious 
vehicle. Consequently, the trust value of the falsely accused 
vehicle increases, leading it to be selected as the miner in the 
blockchain network. The malicious vehicle, now acting as the 
miner, introduces more fraudulent transactions from other 
vehicles into the new block, further jeopardizing the integrity 
of the VANET. This simulation demonstrates the vulnerability 
of the trust mechanism against an attack model implemented in 
a quantum computer, emphasizing the importance of quantum-
resistant 
cryptographic 
methods 
in 
securing 
V2V 
communications in a blockchain-based VANET. 
Figure 5 depicts the quantum circuit implementation with 8 
qubits(q) and 4 classical bits (c) for the prime factorization of 
10 
 
15, where m=7 and N=15. Four of the counting qubits (q0, q1, 
q2, q4, q5, q6 and q7) are into superposition states of (|0>, |1>) 
with equal probability using the Hadamard gate (see “H” in 
Figure 5). Then, we use X-gate or Pauli-X gate (see “X” in 
Figure 5) to convert qubit(q8) from State-0 (an auxiliary qubit) 
to State-1. After that, m is raised to the power of 2𝑞   modulo N 
using a controlled operation to find the modular exponentiation. 
Later, all gates are appended to aggregate every qubit, q, in each 
iteration of modulo operation to form the circuit. After that, an 
inverse QFT is performed on the counting qubits to determine 
the period finding value (state |s>) from the frequency domain 
(superposition state |t>) and appended (with every qubit q) to 
get the circuit. Then, the counting qubits are measured and 
stored the results in the classical bits. 
 
VI. EVALUATION OUTCOMES 
This section is structured into five subsections. The first 
subsection focuses on setting up the simulation platform by 
showing 
blockchain 
based 
VANET 
communication 
characteristics with the simulation time. The second subsection 
discusses the evaluation of the failure of a trust-based PoS-
VANET system if it has been affected by an impersonation 
attack that uses a quantum computer. The accumulated trust 
value was calculated by adding offsets in every triggered event 
and by generating event logs. In the third subsection, we 
evaluate the failure of the trust mechanism due to an 
impersonation attack by examining each vehicle profile. The 
fourth subsection assesses the computational time required for 
a quantum computing-powered attack to meet the time-limited 
consensus-based VANET's blockchain architecture. Finally, we 
analyze IBM's existing roadmap concerning the required 
number of noisy qubits for the factorization of RSA-2048 bits.

Blockchain

Generation 
and 
Communication 
Characteristics without Impersonation Attack 
In this subsection, we first generated blockchain data logs to 
assess the communication characteristics that established the 
framework for a thorough analysis of attack scenarios. This 
subsection helps to evaluate the system performance and 
throughput of the architecture in a non-attack scenario. 
Generating such simulation data by logging and calculating 
trust values ensures system security and integrity. During the 
phase of system setup, a public-private key pair is generated, 
and hash functions required for digital signatures are created to 
maintain security. Data logging starts with tracking and 
analyzing initial transactions, the dissemination and reception 
of messages, and the state of trust chain. These data logs contain 
detailed repositories of transactional information in the 
simulation, including timestamped events detailing the routing 
of packets and information about source, destination, and 
transaction amount. The logging process also shows transaction 
acknowledgement of packet transmission and reception, 
providing information about the start and end of data transfer 
between vehicles and RSUs. The RSU disseminates messages 
about the transaction. These dissemination messages provide 
packet propagation across the network and hold details, such as 
timestamps, transaction amounts, and sender and recipient 
signatures.  
Logging also includes trust value calculation details, such as 
voting messages for consensus from vehicles. Finally, trust 
chain logs work as comprehensive repositories for trust value 
statistics and transaction information, essential for ensuring 
system security and validating transaction integrity. For 
instance, at a particular timestamp, both global and local trust-
chain provide insights into trust chain behavior and initiates 
validator/miner chain requests and chain logs during packet 
handling and transmission.  
From the logging of messages, we observe the vehicular and 
RSU communication over the simulation time, such as 
transmitted messages, chain request messages, disseminated 
messages, voting messages, and transaction acknowledgement 
(Ack) messages. Vehicle authentication and message 
verification with voting results and dissemination messages 
increase communication overhead with simulation time. Figure 
6 depicts a segment of the logging of the simulation being 
conducted over a time span from 0 to 7.003 seconds, with the 
transmission starting at 5.180 seconds. During this period, 
messages were transmitted and received from the RSU and four 
vehicles. Within the simulation time, RSU transmitted 32 
messages, which includes disseminated messages from RSU to 
all vehicles: Vehicle#1 transmitted 8 messages, Vehicle#2 
transmitted 11 messages, Vehicle#3 transmitted 10 messages, 
and Vehicle#4 transmitted 10 messages. Analyzing the 
reception of messages, the RSU received 1 message within this 
time period (as there was no voting done, no voting messages 
were exchanged, and only one chain request was made to RSU), 
Vehicle#1 received 9 messages, Vehicle#2 received 12 
messages, Vehicle#3 received 9 messages, and Vehicle#4 
received 10 messages. This results in an average transmission 
rate of approximately 10.42 messages per 100 seconds and an 
average reception rate of approximately 8.5 messages per 100 
seconds. RSU has a higher transmission rate as it is responsible 
for disseminating messages.  
It is worthy to note that the throughput of the communication 
network—both in non-attack and attack scenarios—remains 
relatively unchanged due to the nature of the impersonation 
attack, which does not directly alter the volume of messages, or 
the data transmission rates within a network. This characteristic 
makes the impersonation attack particularly difficult to 
maintain the integrity of messages through traditional 
blockchain-based system monitoring and throughput analysis 
alone. The attack seamlessly integrates within the trust-based 
framework, maintaining typical throughput levels while subtly 
compromising trust integrity through forged digital signatures. 
This highlights the importance of enhanced security 
mechanisms beyond mere throughput analysis to detect such 
intelligent attacks.

B. Evaluation of Trust-based System Failure 
 
We present a trust-based VANET architecture using 
simulation parameters (as shown in Table I) that fails to detect 
and increases the trust value of a malicious vehicle (i.e., Vehicle 
#2). Note that Vehicle #2 impersonates a legitimate vehicle, i.e., 
Vehicle #3, to complete a malicious transaction. As shown in 
Figure 7, we observe that the accumulated trust value in the 
RSU increases even if a malicious transaction or impersonation 
attack creates false messages that occur within the VANET. 
Trust value increases if the blockchain finds a malicious vehicle 
responsible for the false message transaction. However, this 
creates controversy on the trust-based VANET system, as it 
cannot decrease the trust until it finds a malicious transaction 
that has been impersonated and compromised by a malicious 
vehicle itself. This proves the vulnerability of the trust-based 
system. We also observe that a new block has been written by 
the validator, even if it is a malicious transaction, which leads 
to more malicious transactions in the VANET.  
 
 
 
Fig. 7. Variation of accumulated trust value in RSU. 
 
We found (see Figure 7) that the accumulated trust value 
increases for an event with an increment of 10 even if a 
malicious transaction occurs (indicated as red circles). On the 
other hand, the accumulated trust value increases for an event 
with an increment of 20 due to mining a new block (see the  
 
green circle), whereas the trust value increases with an 
increment of 5 for an authenticated transaction. This shows how 
a trust-based architecture fails to resist an impersonation attack 
and assigns mining responsibilities even if a malicious 
transaction occurs.  
 
 
 
 Fig. 8. Vehicular trust value profiles. 
 
C. Evaluation of Vehicular Profile of Trust Value 
In this subsection, we evaluate trust-chain value of each 
vehicle at the vehicular level without considering trust offsets. 
Figure 8 illustrates the trust value profiles for Vehicle #2 and 
Vehicle #3. As Vehicle #2 executes as an impersonation attack 
utilizing a quantum computer on Vehicle #3, it forges the digital 
signature of Vehicle #3, causing the trust value of Vehicle #3 to 
decline for each malicious transaction. However, the trust value 
of Vehicle #2 increases, making it appear like a trusted node in 
VANET. We observe that Vehicle #3 gets blocked, and its trust 
value reaches zero when it appears to perform malicious 
transactions more than the threshold. Figure 8 shows that 
Vehicle #3 gets suspected of a malicious transaction by 
blockchain consensus mechanism at event 17, and the trust 
value reduces to -1. Vehicle #2 does this impersonation attack, 
but it does not get suspected due to its forging of digital 
signature, and its trust value increases to +1. Again, the same

highest trust values gets selected as the miner. This depicts the 
evaluation of individual vehicular level trust mechanism and 
failure of PoS-based trust-chain architecture (as stakeholders’ 
consensus fails to identify the malicious vehicle).   
 
 
D. Computational Time Requirement 
 
We assess the time required for generating a quantum-based 
private key to satisfy the computational time requirement for 
RSA [15]. To model an impersonation attack that uses a 
quantum computer, it is first necessary to break RSA, decrypt 
the received message, and forge digital signatures. Note that the 
private keys change with a predefined frequency of 10 mins as 
per PoW mechanism-based blockchain [6]. Our approach only 
takes polynomial time complexity and can identify the factors 
for a small key efficiently, which acts as a proof of concept. In 
our case, factoring a 4-bit number like 15 takes between 5 to 17 
seconds. The experiment was conducted 30 times, as this 
sample size of 30 is considered significant for any central limit 
probability distribution. We developed this impersonation 
attack with a small key RSA (4 bits in our experiment) as proof 
of concept due to existing limited computational capacity to 
break 2048-bit RSA. Figure 9 shows that the mean factorization 
time is 10.4 seconds using a Poisson probability distribution of 
30 trials. In addition to this factorization time, additional 
computational time is required to decrypt a message and create 
a false message packet with forged digital signature. The 
OMNET++ stores the total computational time (factorization 
time, message decryption and forged message creation) in a log 
file as shown below. 
 
Total Computational Time = Factorization Time + Message 
Decryption + Forged Message Creation                                                                                
 
Fig. 9. Probability distribution of required time (in seconds) for factorization. 
 
Overall, it takes a mean of 115 seconds, which is 
significantly lower than the 10 minutes required to hack into the 
current block. This ensures that the false message in 
“Mempool” gets sufficient votes within the time constraint. 
Thus, our cyber-attack generation technique utilizes Shor’s 
algorithm implemented in a quantum computer and takes 
advantage of the current limitation of blockchain-based 
VANET. 
 
E. Advancing Toward Computational Requirements to 
Overcome RSA-2048 Bits 
We developed this impersonation attack with a 4 bits RSA as 
a proof of concept due to the existing limited computational 
capacity to break a 2048-bit RSA. For evaluating the feasibility 
of the impersonation attack utilizing Shor’s algorithm 
implemented in a quantum computer, particularly for breaking 
cryptographic schemes like RSA-2048, it is necessary to show 
a roadmap toward achieving quantum speedup in the Noisy 
Intermediate Scale Quantum (NISQ) era. Shor's algorithm, a 
key component of our impersonation attack scheme, 
demonstrated its potential in 2019 by successfully factoring the 
number 35 [45]. For the application of Shor's algorithm in 
factorizing an n-bit integer, the quantum circuit, as outlined   in 
[45], utilizes a total of 2n + 3 qubits. These qubits are 
specifically allocated for various tasks, including modular 
addition, overflow prevention, and ancillary registers for 
modular multiplication. Applying this formula to 2,048-bit 
integer results in a requirement of 4099 qubits (2*2048+3). By 
analyzing IBM's quantum computing roadmap, which 
incorporates the dynamics of noisy qubits, our projection in 
Figure 10 suggests that between 2032 and 2044, IBM's quantum 
infrastructure may have the capacity to efficiently factorize 
RSA-2048 efficiently. This prediction relies on exponential and 
linear regression modeling.  
 
 
Fig.10. IBM quantum roadmap for factorizing RSA-2048 bits. 
 
Although linear regression assumes a linear time-qubit 
relationship, which does not fully capture quantum computing’s 
growth, it serves as a conservative baseline for comparison, 
representing a worst-case scenario. Despite efforts to predict 
quantum computing progress, there's a disparity between the 
number of qubits and their quality (fidelity), posing obstacles to 
predict the roadmap towards factorization of 2048-bits. While 
companies like D-Wave and IBM have experienced exponential 
growth in qubit numbers which is greater than its competitors, 
advancements in high-quality qubits characterized by extended 
                     
          
13 
 
coherence times and low error rates have progressed more 
slowly [46]. IBM utilizes “quantum volume” as a metric to 
assess the performance and quality of its quantum computers. 
Quantum Volume measures both the number of qubits and the 
depth of quantum circuits, offering insights into the system's 
capabilities. The IBM quantum roadmap for factorizing RSA-
2048 bits shows the necessity of understanding quantum 
computing's current constraints, advancements, and potential 
future progress in securing cryptographic applications (see 
Figure 10). 
 
VII. LIMITATIONS OF QUANTUM BLOCKCHAIN AND POST-
QUANTUM BLOCKCHAIN 
 Looking ahead, exploring quantum blockchain and post-
quantum blockchain can make VANET more secure. By 
integrating quantum-resistant cryptographic algorithms into 
blockchain structures, we can better protect against potential 
threats using quantum computer, which is a practical and 
forward-thinking approach to VANET security. There could be 
two primary options to counter quantum threats to blockchains: 
quantum blockchains and post-quantum blockchains.  
 Quantum blockchains use quantum computing concepts like 
quantum key distribution (QKD), quantum digital signatures 
(QDS) and quantum teleportation to enhance efficiency and 
functionality. The QKD-based technique requires dedicated 
quantum communication channels [8], and physically setting up 
such channels is not feasible in a dynamic network, such as 
VANET. In addition, such long-distance QKD transfer in 
quantum secure direct communication channels, which is 
known as quantum relay, could have increased quantum error 
and complexity. Moreover, quantum relays [47] are prone to 
noise and errors as well as concurrent eavesdropping 
(compromised RSU in our case), which will be almost 
impossible to make a fault-tolerant and randomized (random 
qubit measurement) QKD [5] to address security issues.  
Quantum blockchains, while leveraging innovative concepts, 
face obstacles such as the feasibility of establishing dedicated 
quantum communication channels and mitigating inherent 
quantum error and complexity. 
A few studies have been conducted on improving the 
ownership mechanism of blockchain and making it quantum-
safe through post-quantum cryptography [48] and quantum key 
distribution (QKD) [13].  However, post-quantum solutions 
lack standardization, suffer from periodicity and symmetry, and 
use large-size keys, which increase the complexity of the 
decryption of the key, such as a lattice-based architecture [7], 
[49]. 
Hash-based 
cryptography 
[50] 
and 
multivariate 
cryptography [51] exhibit a drawback in the form of large 
signature sizes, leading to a larger block-size and consequently, 
larger memory size. Similarly, code-based cryptography 
encounters the issue of increasing complexity due to larger key 
sizes, demanding extensive memory storage, and the risk of 
decoding failures when utilizing smaller keys in specific 
scenarios [52]. While isogeny-based cryptography is relatively 
new and holds prospects, it requires further enhancements to be 
suitable for practical real-world use. This involves tackling 
issues related to efficient implementation and conducting 
thorough security analyses of specialized schemes such as 
SIDH (Supersingular Isogeny Diffie-Hellman) and CSIDH 
(Commutative Supersingular Isogeny Diffie-Hellman) [53]. 
Post-quantum blockchains can focus on signature approaches, 
privacy-enhancing techniques, and developing decentralized 
applications (dApps) using smart contracts to provide more 
robust chain security. Thus, both quantum and post-quantum 
blockchain solutions, despite their potential, are still in their 
early stages of development in effectively countering quantum-
based attacks. 
 
VIII. CONCLUSION AND RECOMMENDATION  
The impersonation attack model presented in this paper with 
Shor’s algorithm implemented in a quantum computer 
demonstrates a proof of concept to expose the vulnerabilities of 
a blockchain-based VANET.  Even though existing quantum 
computers do not have the necessary computational efficiency 
to break a 2048-bit RSA, we conclude that the presented 
impersonation attack on a 4-bit RSA could act as a proof-of-
concept for such an attack. The paper showcases the feasibility 
of an impersonation attack, with a scale-down of the current 
blockchain encryption standards, for compromising the trust 
chain of the blockchain-based VANET, demonstrating the 
persistence of potential attacks if scaled up. The vulnerability 
in the trust-based framework of blockchain, particularly in 
VANETs, is formulated and examined by the potential for 
impersonation attacks, wherein malicious actors can forge 
digital signatures, undermining the integrity of the trust 
mechanism. The paper shows that quantum computing-based 
attacks could exploit these vulnerabilities, thus posing 
significant threats to VANETs reliant on blockchain 
technology. In this study, an impersonation attack model 
utilizing Shor’s algorithm implemented in a quantum computer 
is developed against a PoS architecture along with the 
consideration of a time-constraint-based PoW mechanism, and 
its effectiveness has been evaluated. Specifically, the 
vulnerability of vertical trust, i.e., vehicle-to-infrastructure 
trust-chain, using the aggregated trust profile at RSU and the 
horizontal trust, i.e., vehicle-to-vehicle trust-chain, is evaluated 
using each vehicle’s trust profile. It reveals that a quantum 
computing-based cyber-attack, i.e., an impersonation attack, is 
able to successfully break the trust chain of a blockchain-based 
VANET. We have also analyzed a timeline and discussed a 
roadmap outlining the progression of quantum computers 
required for such an attack to succeed. The blockchain-based 
VANET requires feasible post-quantum cryptography solutions 
that do not have periodicity, symmetry, or large key problems. 
In future studies, quantum-based short key based post-quantum 
solutions and quantum solutions such as quantum digital 
signatures (QDS), quantum key distribution (QKD) over 
quantum satellites, or 1000 km long quantum communication 
channels could be explored. Therefore, a quantum-secured, 
blockchain-based VANET could serve as a solution for 
ensuring secure vehicular networks in the future.
