Abstract 
Vehicular Ad Hoc Networks (VANET) is a technology that has been recently emerged,  and 
bring a lot of interests. VANET can be used to improve road safety, reduce road traffic, serve 
interests of its users, and provide emergency services. The security is one of the most important 
issues in VANET, it is considered a critical point in the development of robust VANET systems. 
In this paper, a diverse types of security challenges and requirements of VANET will be 
discussed, and a set of possible solutions for VANET security problems and attacks will be 
presented and analyzed. Also this paper will propose a new protocol that is called the reply 
protocol, this protocol aims to protect VANET against several attacks. 
 
Keywords: Vehicular ad hoc networks, security, attacks, certificate validity, mobility 
 
Introduction 
Rapid 
developments 
in 
wireless 
technologies provide possibilities to use 
these technologies in improvement of the 
driving environment, intending to allow road 
safety, 
infotainment 
and 
efficient 
transportation. 
Deaths 
are 
increasing 
dramatically in the world, and a significant 
proportion of these deaths lies on roads, 
around 1.2 million people are killed on roads 
yearly worldwide, and more than 50 million 
are injured. These numbers will increase by 
about 60% in next few years if no actions 
are taken[1], all of that in addition to other 
harms such as waste of time that is caused 
by traffic jams. 
Vehicular Ad Hoc Networks (VANET) is a 
wireless networks, where vehicles are 
connected to each others, and can connect 
with internet. VANET is a special group of a 
Mobile Ad Hoc Networks (MANET), where 
nodes move freely, this means that there are 
no constraints on its movement. Each node 
will stay connected when it changes its 
location, as consequence VANETs have a 
highly 
dynamic 
topology. 
Nodes 
are 
communicating with each other in single 
hop or multi hop. Each node in VANET is 
either vehicle or Road Side Unit (RSU). 
Communications in VANET are divided 
into two categories: Vehicle to Vehicle 
(V2V) communication, and Vehicle to 
Infrastructure (V2I) communication. In 
V2V, vehicle can communicate with other 
vehicles, involves sending and receiving 
messages to or from other vehicles. V2I 
takes place when vehicles communicate 
with RSU. These communications enable 
different applications to improve road safety 
and efficient transportation [4]. 
VANET is vulnerable to several attacks, 
because the nature of its open access

medium. The security is the most important 
issue in VANET. To immune the members 
of VANET from attacks such as denial of 
service attack, many securing methods are 
proposed. 
This paper investigates and analyzes the 
security challenges that are facing VANET 
and causing many problems, and presents 
comprehensive information about various 
VANET security requirements, challenges, 
possible attacks, and possible solutions that 
have been proposed. 
The rest of this paper is organized as 
following: in section II we described 
VANET structure and how they are 
working, section III we list different attacks 
that threaten VANET and classified it, in 
section IV we identified the VANET 
challenges, like availability and mobility, 
section 
V 
discusses 
the 
security 
requirements that have to be met to enable 
secure system, in section VI we discussed 
different solutions that are proposed to solve 
the VANET problems, section VII discusses 
the proposed solutions, and section VIII 
concludes the paper. 
 
How VANET works 
As mentioned above, nodes are forming 
VANET, and the number of these nodes are 
too large, currently there are more than 800 
million vehicles in the world[2]. The 
communications 
between 
nodes 
done 
through using radio signals, range of these 
signals 
can 
reach 
up 
to 
1 
KM. 
Communications between nodes that have 
distance exceeds the signal range demand 
messages to hop across multiple nodes. 
Routing is done by a RSU, RSU plays as a 
router between vehicles. However, the 
following 
figure 
shows 
the 
VANET 
structure[3] and [15]. 
In order to connect vehicles with RSU using 
radio signals, each vehicle must be equipped 
with an On Board Unit (OBN). Tamper 
Proof Device (TPD) is a device that holds all 
vehicle secrets such as driver identity, speed, 
and position[3]. 
Fig. 1: VANET structure [3] 
 
Attacks and threats 
The attacks against VANET affect its 
behaviour, to deal with these attacks, many 
researchers are classified these attacks. 
Researchers in [3], [6], [13], and [9] 
presented 
different 
classifications 
for 
attacks. Researchers in [6] classified attacks 
as attacks that pose a threat to availability, 
attacks that pose a threat to authenticity and 
attacks that pose a threat to driver 
confidentiality, and miscellaneous. While 
researchers in [13] classified attackers into 
three classes: Insider vs. Outsider, Malicious 
vs. Rational, and Active vs. Passive. 
Different 
classification 
proposed 
by 
researchers in [9], they classified attacks as 
Network Attack (NA), Timing Attack (TA), 
Monitoring Attack (MA), Social Attack 
(SA) and Application Attack (AP). Another 
classification 
suggested 
in 
[3], 
here 
researchers classified attackers into three 
classes: Selfish Driver, Malicious Attacker, 
and 
Pranksters. 
Each 
class 
describes 
different types of attacks. However, in this 
section we discuss and analyze some of 
these attacks. 
 
A. Denial of Service attack 
Denial Of Service (DOS) attacks aim to 
make the network unavailable to its 
legitimate vehicles. Such attacks try to 
breakdown the network, and prevent sending 
and receiving of messages through the 
network to other vehicles. This happened 
when the attacker jams the network 
communication medium channel, or makes 
 
IJSAR, 2(4), 2015; 50-55 
52 
 
exclusive control of a vehicle's resources. In 
VANET, this attack is considered one of the 
most dangerous attacks, as the vehicles can't 
access the network and passing information 
messages to other vehicles[3], [5], [6], and 
[7]. 
 
B. Sybil Attack 
This attack includes sending multiple copies 
of messages to other vehicles, and each 
message contain a fabricated identity, i.e. an 
attacker appears to other vehicles as 
hundreds of vehicles with different ids, 
telling them there is jam ahead and enforce 
them to take another route[3], [5], and [6]. 
 
C. Alteration Attack 
Such attack happens when the attacker 
modifies or changes an existing data. This 
attack 
includes 
either 
delaying 
the 
transmitting 
of 
information 
messages, 
repeating previously transmitted messages, 
or modifying the original content of message 
and data transmitted[3], and [7]. 
 
D. Message Suppression Attack 
Messages are sent and received as packets, 
an attacker can select some of these packets 
and dropping it. These packets may contain 
critical information. The attacker can keep 
these packets for later using. For example, 
an attacker might drop the jams alerts it 
receives, 
preventing 
it 
from 
being 
transmitted to the other vehicles, these alerts 
could help in selecting another path to 
destination, the vehicles that are not 
informed, enforce to wait in traffic. The 
dropped packets may be used again later to 
obtain the benefits. The main objective of 
the attacker is to deny the jams and 
collisions 
information 
from 
reaching 
authorities[3], [6], and [7]. 
 
E. Identity Disclosure 
An attacker obtains the Identity (ID) of the 
target node and its current location to track 
them. This is achieved by sending malicious 
code to the adjacent of the target node to get 
the required data, as result the privacy of the 
target node will be disclosed. Rental 
companies use the tracked data to keep track 
of the movement of their vehicles[5], and 
[6].  
 
F. Spamming 
Spamming attacks aim to consume the 
network 
bandwidth 
and 
increase 
the 
transmission latency. The users are not 
interested 
in 
such 
messages, 
like 
advertisement messages[6]. 
 
VANET Challenges 
A. Mobility 
The vehicles in VANET have a highly 
dynamic topology,  because it move freely, 
and during its movement it connect through 
the way with many vehicles that may never 
be faced before. The vehicles stay connected 
only for too short time, then the connection 
is lost as each vehicle moves toward its 
direction, this make the securing of VANET 
difficult to be achieved[3]. 
 
B. Volatility 
The connectivity among nodes in VANET 
can be highly fleeting, and live only for a 
limited period of time. As mentioned above, 
vehicles during movements can connect to 
other vehicles, so this connection will not 
stay for long time as the vehicles move 
freely, and change its movements directions. 
VANET lacks the relatively long-lived 
context, but contacting users device to a hot 
spot will demand long life password, 
something like this is impractical for 
securing vehicular communication[3], and 
[13]. 
 
C. Network Scale 
Current number of vehicles around the 
world exceeds 800 million, and this number 
are increased rapidly, which making the 
network scalable is difficult, and another 
problem will arise because the absence of a 
global authority existence that governs the 
standards for this network[8]. 
 
IJSAR, 2(4), 2015; 50-55 
53 
 
D. Bootstrap 
VANET is a promising technology, and 
requires that each vehicle equipped with 
Dedicated Short Range Communications 
(DSRC) radios, but until this moment, there 
are small number of vehicles satisfying this 
condition, so in developing applications for 
VANET, we must take into account that the 
communications will be limited to a few 
number of vehicles[3]. 
 
Security Requirements in VANET  
In order to have a secure VANET, a number 
of security requirements must be satisfied, 
some of these requirements are needed to a 
network as a whole, and some of them are 
specific to VANET only. However, these 
requirements must be considered when 
designing vehicular network to hinder the 
attacks against VANET. 
 
A. Authentication 
Means that to be able to send and receive 
messages through the network, VANET 
nodes must be authenticated. Authentication 
includes the process of verifying of the 
sender identity, and determine if he has the 
rights 
to 
communicate 
through 
the 
network[13]. 
 
B. Availability 
Availability needs high connectivity and 
bandwidth. the network must be available 
when it is needed, and sometimes it must 
have fast response time for specific 
applications, any delaying even if it takes 
milliseconds 
will 
make 
the 
message 
meaningless[6]. 
 
C. Privacy 
The personal and private information of 
drivers and vehicles must not be available to 
unauthorized access,  i.e. immune of private 
information 
to 
be 
observed 
from 
unauthorized access. 
 
D. Integrity 
In order, to trust messages contents, all 
messages that are sent and received through 
network must be protected against alteration 
attacks. 
 
E. Non-Repudiation 
When sending a message, the attacker may 
wish to deny that sending, to avoid its 
responsibility. 
Non-repudiation 
enables 
identifying the attackers and prevents them 
from disavowal their crimes. This is 
achieved 
because 
all 
information 
are 
recorded and stored on TPD, so any 
authorized official side can retrieve this 
data[3].  
 
Security solutions 
To 
provide 
secure 
VANET, 
many 
researchers introduced a set of solutions to 
solve 
different 
security 
problems 
in 
VANET, researchers in [10], and [13] 
proposed the using of Vehicular Public Key 
Infrastructure (VPKI), here every node 
sends a safety message, it signs that message 
with its private key, and attaches it with 
Certificate Authority (CA). The receiver 
party of the message, will get the public key 
of the sending party by using the certificate, 
and check the signature of that sender, using 
its certified public key, but this solution 
requires that the CA public key be known by 
the receiver party. 
Researchers [11] proposed using of group of 
signature, but this is not good solution, as a 
lot of overhead can be raised when using 
this solution. The idea behind this approach 
is that, there is a public key for a group of 
vehicles, and each vehicle has a session key, 
but when a new vehicle enters the group 
domain, the group public key as well as the 
vehicle session key of the vehicles in that 
domain must be altered and transmitted, also 
making the group static is difficult, as the 
vehicles 
have 
high 
mobility 
and 
continuously change their topology, as result 
 
IJSAR, 2(4), 2015; 50-55 
54 
 
the keys will be changed and transmitted 
frequently. 
Another solution is proposed by [12], 
researchers suggested a new protocol for 
message checking, this protocol involves 
checking the Certificate Validity (CV) of the 
sender, the receiver of the message checks 
the CV of the message sender, the result of 
checking has three cases: in the first case, 
the receiver will consider the message if the 
sender has a valid certificate, second case 
occurs 
when 
the 
sender 
has 
invalid 
certificate, in this case the receiver will not 
regard the message, in the third case, the 
sender has not CV at all, the receiver will 
inform the RSU with the sender and check 
the received message, if it is correct the 
RSU will issue CV for the sender, otherwise 
it will issue invalid certificate and record 
vehicle's 
identity 
into 
the 
Certificate 
Revocation List (CRL). However, the next 
figure shows how the protocol works [12]. 
 
 
Fig. 2: Message checking protocol[12] 
 
Other researchers proposed some solutions 
for different attacks. For example, to avoid 
DOF attacks, researchers in  [8] suggested 
that switching between different channels or 
even communication technologies (e.g., 
DSRC, 
UTRA-Time 
Division 
Duplex 
(ULTRA-TDD), or even Bluetooth for very 
short ranges), if they are available, when one 
of them (typically DSRC) is brought down, 
while researchers in [13] said that frequency 
hopping do not completely solve the 
problem. 
The 
use 
of 
multiple 
radio 
transceivers, operating in disjoint frequency 
bands, can be a feasible approach. 
To protect vehicular network against Sybil 
attacks, researchers in [14] proposed a 
solution, this solution  involves using on 
road radar, where each vehicle can see 
surrounding vehicles and receive reports of 
their GPS coordinates. By comparing what 
is seen to what has been heard, a vehicle can 
corroborate the real position of neighbours 
and isolate malicious vehicles. 
 
Proposed solutions 
Reply Protocol 
In this protocol, when a vehicle sends a 
message to another vehicle, the receiver 
vehicle informs the nearest RSU, and 
requests it to check the correctness of the 
message, the RSU will communicate with 
the responsible RSU (which reside at the 
location of the sender vehicle), the latter 
RSU checks the message correctness by 
asking a random vehicle. Afterwards, the 
result will be distributed to all vehicles 
within the range of that RSU, and these 
vehicles will pass these messages through 
the way. 
Another solution is proposed to protect 
vehicular 
networks 
against 
message 
suppression attack, the packets that are sent, 
attached with a time, this time indicating the 
initial time of packets sending, that time 
determines the age of these packets, if the 
attacker selects some of these packets and 
drops them, and tries to retransmit it again 
later, such packets become out of order, and 
other vehicles will not respond to it. 
 
Conclusion 
To make the development of VANET 
systems worth the effort, different security 
requirements 
and 
conditions 
must 
be 
 
IJSAR, 2(4), 2015; 50-55

satisfied. 
This 
paper 
has 
provided, 
discussed, 
and 
analyzed 
the 
VANET 
challenges, requirements, attacks, and its 
solutions. We have shown that the using of 
VPKI is giving the optimal solution. Also, 
we proposed a new protocol called the reply 
protocol, and we proposed another solution 
for message suppression attack.  In the 
future work, we intend to suggest new 
solutions and protocols that can be enhance 
the VANET security and simulate these 
solutions.
