Vehicular communication networks represent both an opportunity and a challenge for pro- 
viding smart mobility services by using a hybrid solution that relies on cellular connectivity and 
short range communications. The evaluation of this kind of network is overwhelmingly carried 
out in the present literature with simulations. However, the degree of realism of the results 
obtained is limited because simulations simplify real world interactions too much in many 
cases. In this article, we define an outdoor testbed to evaluate the performance of short range 
vehicular communications by using real world personal portable devices (smartphones, 
tablets, and laptops), two different PHY standards (IEEE 802.11g and IEEE 802.11a), and vehi- 
cles. Our test results on the 2.4 GHz band show that smartphones can be used to communicate 
vehicles within a range up to 75 m, while tablets can attain up to 125 m in mobility conditions. 
Moreover, we observe that vehicles equipped with laptops exchange multimedia information 
with nodes located further than 150 m. The communications on the 5 GHz band achieved an 
effective transmission range of up to 100 m. This, together with the optimization of the pro- 
tocols used, could take our commodity lightweight devices to a new realm of use in the next 
generation of ad hoc mobility communications for moving through the city. 
 
 
 
 
1. Introduction 
 
Today, the longstanding promise of deploying applica- 
tions to improve eﬃciency and safety in road transport is 
becoming a reality. A number of smart mobility solutions 
based on Intelligent Transport Systems (ITS) provide road 
users with information of traﬃc conditions by using wireless 
communication. This information is generally delivered to 
in-vehicle navigation systems via FM radio broadcast by using 
the Traﬃc Message Channel (TMC) or via digital media by 
using the Transport Protocol Experts Group (TPEG) [1]. New 
applications for smartphones and tablets may also

receive this information via 3G or Long Term Evolution (LTE, 
4G) cellular networks. 
However, there are several drawbacks to most of these 
services [2]: (i) they are centralized and based on a fixed and 
costly infrastructure, e.g., over-roadway and in-roadway sen- 
sors; (ii) such systems only provide traﬃc information about 
the main roads in the city; and (iii) the information updates are 
in the range of 20–50 min, far from ideal real-time. 
Over the last decade, the research community, the 
industry, and the authorities have been working on the 
deployment of vehicular ad hoc networks (VANETs). The idea 
is to equip vehicles with devices with wireless capabili- 
ties, such as dedicated on-board units or general-purpose 
smartphones and tablets, that allow short range communi- 
cations to deploy volatile wireless networks on the roads. 
Thus, vehicles, as VANET nodes, may exchange useful traf- 
fic information to each other by using vehicle-to-vehicle

(V2V) communications. In turn, infrastructure elements, 
i.e., traﬃc lights, traﬃc signs, information panels, etc., with 
wireless communication capabilities are other types of 
VANET nodes that communicate with vehicles by using 
vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) communications. Recently, 
the whole system has been extended to include personal 
pedestrian devices (P2I) as VANET nodes (see Fig. 1). 
VANET technologies represent an opportunity to improve 
ITS services and applications by using short range commu- 
nications. The main advantages of using VANETs are that (1) 
they are decentralized and totally distributed networks, (2) 
the vehicles are equipped with sensors that generate and 
update data about all roads visited, and (3) the information 
received can be fully personalized according to the user. 
However, it should be taken into account that VANET’s 
performance is highly dependent on its market penetration. 
The more vehicles in the VANETs (distributed over more 
roads), the better the service they provide (more information 
and more updates). 
Currently, much of the research effort is focused on defin- 
ing the most appropriate architecture for vehicular networks 
(radio technologies, protocols, etc.) and on developing the 
promising ITS services to achieve smart mobility [3]. This re- 
search has resulted in three major architectures for vehicular 
communications: CALM (communications access for land 
mobiles) proposed by the International Standard Organiza- 
tion (ISO) [4], WAVE (wireless access in vehicular environ- 
ments) produced by the Institute of Electrical and Electronic 
Engineers (IEEE) [5], and ITS-5G fostered by the European 
Telecommunications Standards Institute (ETSI) [6]. An 
important issue in this kind of research is the accurate eval- 
uation of the solutions produced. As in most network envi- 
ronments, modelers, simulators, emulators, and application- 
dependent implementations are used for this purpose. 
Modelers and simulators rely on mathematical formulas 
to determine the behavior of network protocols and appli- 
cations. These analytic methods are limited by the complex- 
ity and dimension of real world systems, which usually re- 
quire simplifications and approximations that generally lead 
to greater differences between their results and real world 
behavior. Emulators mimic the entire functionality of other 
systems (hardware, software, and network activity), accept- 
ing the same data, executing the same programs, and achiev- 
ing similar results as the system being imitated. In the litera- 
ture, the majority of the tools used to evaluate VANETs are a 
kind of modeler or simulator [7,8]. 
As a useful complement (or even realistic substitute) for 
simulations we can use experimental real testbeds. Testbeds 
have important advantages with respect to the aforemen- 
tioned approaches because the test can be carried out in a real 
world environment offering close-to-real or real perfor- 
mance, as well as revealing behavioral issues [9]. However, 
there is a lack of scientific articles that use outdoor experi- 
ments in the field of vehicular networks. The main reasons for 
this may be the unavailability of resources (vehicles and road 
equipment), the diﬃculties in doing field studies, and the 
accuracy of the performance analysis. 
In the present article, we carry out a set of outdoor ex- 
periments to analyze VANET communications. The idea is to 
prove the feasibility of VANET short range communications 
when using smartphones, tablets, and laptops. Moreover, we 
analyze other kinds of characteristics of these devices that 
are useful for VANET applications, e.g., the human machine 
interface (HMI) provided. In this article we do not intend to 
define a platform for vehicular communications differ- ent 
from the ones proposed by the ISO or the ETSI. Instead, we 
want to analyze the possibility of using such widespread 
lightweight commodity devices to provide ITS services to im- 
prove road transport in nowadays scenarios, where specific 
VANET devices are not available to most road users. The main 
goals of our work are therefore: 
• Analyzing the main features that personal mobile devices 
provide for deploying VANETs without having to acquire 
new equipment for vehicles. 
• Defining an outdoor testbed in an urban area to evaluate 
vehicle wireless communications. 
• Studying the wireless capabilities of the devices analyzed 
in order to discuss their use in the deployment of VANETs. 
The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. Section 
2 reviews the literature in VANET communications analysis. 
Section 3 presents the three types of devices ana- lyzed in this 
work. Section 4 provides the details about the urban VANET 
testbed definition and experimental settings. Section 5 shows 
the results and discusses the performance observed in the 
experimentation. Finally, conclusions and fu- ture work are 
presented in Section 6. 
 
2. Related work 
 
In the last decade, a number of research projects managed 
by governmental, academic, and industrial entities, such as 
CARLINK [10], Cooperative Vehicle-Infrastructure Systems 
(CVIS) [11], SAFESPOT Integrated [12], DRIVE C2X [13], and 
PRESERVE [14], have been pushing to enhance the advanced 
driver assistance systems (ADAS) to provide cooperative road 
traﬃc solutions. In turn, the main international standardiza- 
tion institutes are involved in the specification of common 
frameworks and architectures for vehicular communications. 
The main initiatives proposed are the following: CALM by the 
ISO, WAVE by the IEEE, and C2C-CC (Car-to-Car Communica- 
tion Consortium) [15] and ITS-5G by the ETSI. 
The evaluation of the different approaches (radio tech- 
nologies, protocols, and network models) to deploy vehic- 
ular networks is a major concern in this research field. In the 
literature, most studies aimed at this task have applied 
simulators and modelers. The authors have used three dif- 
ferent types of strategies to simulate VANETs: utilizing a 
well-known network simulator, such as Ns-2/Ns-3 [7] or OP- 
NET [16], that allows users to define the movement of the 
J. Toutouh, E. Alba / Ad Hoc Networks 37 (2016) 499–511 
501 
 
 
nodes by generating realistic VANET traces with transporta- 
tion simulators, such as SUMO [17] or VISSIM [18]; coupling 
vehicular traﬃc and wireless network in a single simula- tor, 
e.g., GrooveNet [19]; and the most promising approach, 
synchronizing the existing and validated traﬃc and network 
simulators by using some specific bridge software, such as 
TraNS [20] or iTetris [8]. 
Even if the simulators have achieved a high degree of re- 
alism and they obtain quite accurate results, the real world 
simplifications that they apply in their mathematical defini- 
tions still limit their performance. Thus, in the literature, we 
can find some studies that define real world testbeds to ana- 
lyze the feasibility of cooperative communications (V2V and 
V2I), and to test different VANET solutions, as protocols and 
applications. 
The feasibility is generally proven by performing differ- 
ent measurements of the communications on the road in re- 
alistic conditions. An evaluation of V2I communications by 
attempting to exchange data between vehicles and a set of 
access points dotted around the city of Boston in USA was 
presented in [21]. Different studies [22–24] have analyzed 
the feasibility of VANET communications by using vehicle 
gateways defined by laptops equipped with a IEEE 802.11bg 
wireless interface with an external Bluetooth-based GPS. 
Moreover, the literature presents other testbeds that fo- 
cus on analyzing highly-demanding applications and pro- 
tocols over different types of traﬃc conditions to study the 
main factors that affect their quality-of-service (QoS). Thus, 
[23,25] analyzed the performance of content sharing over 
VANETs, in [26], the authors analyzed FleetNet’s com- plete 
platform services. All these studies used specific hard- ware 
(on-board units or laptops) installed in the vehicles. 
Recently, as the last proposals of the ISO, the ETSI, and 
the IEEE are based on IEEE 802.11p [27], some studies were 
presented to analyze the capabilities of such a MAC and PHY 
layer for vehicular communications. The measurement of 
the performance of IEEE 802.11p PHY standard was carried 
out via V2I communications on an Austrian highway [28]. An 
analysis of Non-Line-Of-Sight (NLOS) reception quality of 
IEEE 802.11p at intersections in urban areas of Munich was 
presented in [29]. As the availability of IEEE 802.11p devices 
is very limited at present, other authors have decided to carry 
out experiments using IEEE 802.11a, which uses the band (5 
GHz) closest to the one used by IEEE 802.11p. Sánchez et 
al. [24] studied VARON, a multi-hop wireless vehicular 
communication protocol, configuring the devices with IEEE 
802.11a. 
Finally, some other studies have analyzed ITS services that 
require the use of cellular networks (3G/LTE). For ex- ample, 
[30] presents an Android application that evaluates the 
behavior of the drivers and indicates how to reduce fleet 
degradation, insurance policy cost, and fuel consumption. 
Similarly, [9] introduces DRIVE, a reconfigurable VANET plat- 
form that allows experimental analysis of vehicular commu- 
nications over real world tests that include direct short range 
and cellular network connectivity. 
The interest of the present study is that the method- ology 
includes an analysis of widely used portable devices 
(smartphones and tablets) when used in ad hoc communi- 
cations, i.e., the use of such devices to exchange data with 
nearby nodes in a vehicular environment. In this analysis, we

evaluate the wireless capabilities, but also, we study other 
features of these devices that can be useful in vehicular ap- 
plications. Our analysis is neutral, in the sense that we do 
not focus on any one application as many other previous ap- 
proaches have, thereby hopefully reaching a broader commu- 
nity of researchers. The use of such widely used devices to 
deploy VANETs could ease a faster penetration of this tech- 
nology in our society. 
 
3. VANET ubiquitous devices 
 
In our testbed, three different kinds of VANET nodes are 
defined depending on the type of the device used to equip the 
vehicles: a smartphone, a tablet or a laptop. To this end we 
use three devices that are readily available in the present 
market, as well as fairly standard in the features we are evalu- 
ating here: Samsung Galaxy SII (Gt - I9100) smartphones, Sam- 
sung Galaxy Tab Gt - P7510 tablets, and HP Pavilion dv6-3181ss 
laptops that use ALFA AWVS051NH USB Wi-Fi transceivers. 
Fig. 2 shows our experimental VANET nodes. 
The possible use of smartphones and tablets to deploy 
VANETs could accelerate the development of these kinds of 
networks, as these devices are already widely used by the 
population, this would in turn ease VANET’s market penetra- 
tion while the supply of on-board units specifically designed 
for vehicular communications is not widespread. In turn, 
these devices themselves are equipped with high process- 
ing capabilities (multi-core CPUs), many useful sensors for 
ITS applications (GPS, accelerometer, thermometer, compass, 
etc.), along with the required wireless connectivity (Blue- 
tooth, Wi-Fi, and cellular links). Next, we present these three 
devices that have been used to deploy the VANET nodes of 
our testbed. 
 
3.1. Smartphones/Tablets for equipping VANET nodes 
 
Nowadays, our lives are flooded with personal mobile de- 
vices and it is common to see people walking around with 
a smartphone or a tablet in their hands. For this reason, we 
propose using them to deploy VANETs, thus avoiding the need 
to buy and install any new hardware in vehicles. 
As shown in Fig. 3, smartphones and tablets provide 
a complete set of solutions to fulfill the requirements of 
a VANET node. In order to perform V2V/V2I, cellular, and in-
vehicle communications they include IEEE 802.11bgn,

cellular, and Bluetooth interfaces, respectively. The Bluetooth 
interface may be used to interact with the on-board diagnos- 
tics (OBD) reader and with the internal sensors of the vehi- cle. 
The internal GPS antenna makes the vehicle’s geolocation 
possible, which is required by most ITS services and applica- 
tions. 
In addition, smartphones and tablets offer three differ- ent 
human-machine interfaces (HMI): the touch-screen, the 
microphone, and the speakers. The later two are really use- ful 
because drivers should not have to use their hands nor look 
away from the road to interact with the devices, thereby 
avoiding distractions that can cause dangerous situations on 
the road. 
Both devices offer several internal hardware components 
such as one or two cameras, a USB interface, and a set of sen- 
sors. These components can be used by different types of ser- 
vices or applications, e.g., the accelerometer can be used to 
detect a collision to inform of possible road accidents. 
In terms of wireless communication capabilities, both 
types of devices used here integrate the same Broadcom 
BCM4330 wireless chip, but the tablet is bigger than the 
smartphone, and therefore, the antenna is larger and better 
located in tablet devices. Finally, in our testbed, we require 
the vehicles during the experiments to be located, and there- 
fore, we utilize the GPS antenna integrated in these devices. 
3.2. Laptops for equipping VANET nodes 
 
By taking data when using laptops, we want to cover a 
range of scenarios where a powerful on-board unit is used. As 
shown in Fig. 4, most laptops provide two different types of 
wireless interfaces: IEEE 802.11abgn and Bluetooth. The first 
one can be used for V2V and V2I communications, and Blue- 
tooth for in-vehicle communications. In order to perform cel- 
lular network communications the laptop requires an exter- 
nal cellular modem. In general, laptops do not include GPS 
antennas, so an external one may be required (see Fig. 2.c). 
In the tests carried out in this study, we evaluate the V2V 
communications by using a laptop as the on-board unit. The 
laptops use an external ALFA AWVS051NH USB Wi-Fi 
transceiver, which includes an omnidirectional gain antenna 
that provides 2.5 dBi for transmitting on the 2.4 GHz band 
and 5 dBi for transmitting on the 5 GHz band. We also use the 
external Bluetooth GPS antenna to locate the vehicles during 
the experiments (see Fig. 2.c). 
Fig. 4. Main features used in VANETs of laptops. 
 
 
In terms of HMI, laptops usually provide a larger screen 
than smartphones and tablets, in addition to the keyboard, 
the touch-pad, the microphone, and the speakers. However, 
the idea is to use the speakers and the microphone to interact 
with the system to avoid possible distractions. 
For the interaction with the vehicle, as in the case of mo- 
bile personal devices, a Bluetooth OBD reader can be used. 
It is important to take into account that smartphones and 
tablets provide a set of extra sensors, but laptops do not. So, 
ITS applications and services can access the information pro- 
vided for the internal sensors installed in the car and the ex- 
ternal sensors connected via USB or Bluetooth interfaces. 
Finally, there is a drawback in using laptops as the main 
device for VANET nodes, which is the need for a specific space 
to place it in the car. This space is larger than the one needed 
to place smartphones or tablets. 
 
4. Urban testbed deﬁnition 
 
The experiments carried out in this study aim to analyze 
the feasibility of using personal mobile devices (smartphones 
and tablets) and laptops to deploy VANETs. Therefore, we 
have designed two different types of experiments: first, the 
evaluation of the power of the wireless signal generated by 
the analyzed devices, and second, tests to characterize the 
QoS of V2V communications when nodes use smartphones, 
tablets, and laptops. 
 
4.1. VANET scenarios 
 
The VANET testbed has been defined in an urban area of 
Málaga city (Spain) of 1.15 Km2 covering a zone of the campus 
of the University of Málaga (see Fig. 5). The two experiments 
described here were both carried out in this area. 
The evaluation of the power of the wireless signal gener- 
ated by the devices studied has been carried out by measur- 
ing the signal strength at different points located at distances 
between 0 and 150 m. In this case the cars are stopped at 
a given point and we use another portable device to evalu- ate 
the power of the signal. As the cars are stopped we have 
named these experiments static experiments. 
These static experiments have involved the signal strength 
evaluation of each device in 21 different points. The points are 
located at distances between 0 and 150 m and they are 
separated from each other by 7.5m (see Fig. 6.a). The distance

of each point i with the evaluated device is defined by (1). 
distancei = i × 7.5 m ∀i ∈ {0, 1,..., 20} 
(1) 
The study of the feasibility of V2V communications has 
been done by defining a VANET comprising two cars that ex- 
change data with each other. These cars move along a regu- 
lar road of the testbed area that defines a circuit of 3,800 m 
(see Fig. 5). During the experiments, the speed of the vehi- cles 
is between 15 and 50 Km/h. Thus, we have evaluated different 
QoS metrics of the communications carried out in different 
situations. These experiments are called dynamic experiments. 
In order to study how the distance between the VANET 
nodes also influences the performance of the communica- 
tions, we have carried out different tests by modifying the 
distance between the vehicles over the journey in the dy- 
namic experiments. As it was very diﬃcult to maintain the 
same distances between the nodes as the ones defined for the 
experiments of the signal strength analysis because of the 
speed variations of the cars, we have used longer distances 
(distances multiple of 25 m). Thus, as shown in Fig. 6.b, we 
have defined different experiments with the two vehicles 
separated by six different distances grouped in medium dis- 
tance (25, 50, and 75 m) and long distance (100, 125, and 
150 m). 
As the road was open to traﬃc, other vehicles were able to 
circulate, and therefore, our vehicles were affected as in a real 
life journey (neither constant speeds nor fixed distances 
between each other). In fact, other vehicles on the road could 
come in between the VANET nodes, thus affecting the wire- 
less signal propagation (see Fig. 7.b). Note that in an urban 
area, buildings and other obstacles may also interfere and

result in a far from ideal signal propagation: another reason 
supporting our choice of real world tests. 
 
4.2. Description of the tests 
 
The main idea is to analyze the use of lightweight devices’ 
communication capabilities to deploy VANETs. Thus, we have 
selected the three different devices presented in Section 3 
and defined two types of experiments: the wireless signal 
power measurement and the V2V data transfer evaluation. 
The wireless interfaces of the smartphones, the tablets, 
and the laptops were configured with the widely used IEEE 
802.11g mode that operates on the 2.4 GHz band and pro- 
vides interoperability with IEEE 802.11b standard, and there- 
fore, these devices can exchange information with most end 
user wireless devices. We also studied the communications 
between laptops when applying the IEEE 802.11a standard 
that operates on the 5 GHz band. We have also included this 
standard in our testbed because the vehicular communica- 
tions proposed by the ISO, the ETSI, and the IEEE are all based 
on IEEE 802.11p, a modified version of this one [27]. 
Specifically, the devices use Channel 6 of the 2.4 GHz band, 
whose nominal frequency is 2.437 GHz during IEEE 802.11g 
experiments. We have selected this channel because when 
channels 1, 6 or 11 are used, there is less potential for in- 
terference from other IEEE 802.11bg access points [31]. For 
IEEE 802.11a experiments, the devices use Channel 140 of the 
5 GHz band, whose nominal frequency is 5.700 GHz. 
The power of the signal of each device is evaluated in static 
experiments which consist of evaluating the received signal 
strength in a given point for 15 s (see Section 4.1). 
In order to evaluate the feasibility of V2V communications 
by using the three types of devices and the two IEEE 802.11 
standards, we have defined dynamic experiments. These

504 
 
 
 
 
 
Fig. 8. Representation of the communications analyzed in this study. 
 
 
 
experiments consist in evaluating different QoS metrics of 
the VANET communications between two mobile vehicles. 
Seven kinds of VANET communication schemes are an- 
alyzed in the dynamic experiments. These communication 
schemes are distinguished by the devices connected to 
exchange the information and the IEEE 802.11 standard. 
They are named using the following format: <device1> - 
<device2>. Note that for the laptops we have included a cap- 
ital letter to specify the PHY/MAC standard used, i.e., “A” 
for IEEE 802.11a and “G” for IEEE 802.11g. The smartphones 
and the tablets always communicate using IEEE 802.11g, 
therefore, we have not used any letter to specify the stan- 
dard. Thus the communication schemes analyzed here are: 
smartphone-smartphone (sph-sph), smartphone-tablet (sph- 
tab), smartphone-laptopG (sph-laptG), tablet-tablet (tab-tab), 
tablet-laptopG (tab-laptG), laptopG-laptopG (laptG-laptG), 
and laptopA-laptopA (laptA-laptA). Fig. 8 summarizes these 
seven communication schemes. 
We have carried out 42 different tests for the dynamic 
experiments. Each test was defined according to one of the 
seven aforementioned communication schemes and one of 
the six distances between nodes (see Section 4.1). These tests 
are named according to the communication scheme and the 
distance: <communication scheme> - <distance>. For in- 
stance, sph-sph-25 m refers to the test in which both nodes 
are equipped with smartphones and are separated by 25 m 
while they are moving and tab-laptG-125 m represents the 
test in which one of the vehicles is equipped with a tablet and 
the other with a laptop (IEEE 802.11g) and they are sep- arated 
by 125 m. 
The V2V transferring data tests consist of exchanging data 
streams from the source node to the destination node of the 
VANET while the cars are moving. The information exchange 
is done by using ICMP (Internet Control Message Protocol) 
packets that encapsulate the bytes of data to be sent. We have 
selected this protocol as the use case protocol because we 
want to evaluate the feasibility of V2V (peer-to-peer) com- 
munications. We do not want to test any specific type of ap- 
plication or service, and therefore, we decided to avoid any 
connection-oriented protocol, such as the TCP (Transmission 
Control Protocol), or any other transaction-oriented protocol, 
as UDP (User Datagram Protocol). In order to study the effects 
of the size of data packets on the performance of the VANET 
communications, we performed data transfers by exchanging 
five kinds of data packets for each V2V test, that are defined 
by their size (32, 64, 128, 256, and 512 bytes of data). For each 
one of the five types of data packets, each VANET node trans- 
fers to the other streams of 100 independent packets each. 
 
5. Experimental analysis 
 
In this section, we present the different metrics that we 
have studied to evaluate the VANET communications and the 
results obtained after performing the real world experiments 
presented in Section 4. 
 
5.1. VANET communication performance metrics 
 
In the static experiments, the wireless transmission power 
of each device was evaluated in terms of the received signal 
strength indicator (RSSI) in a given location. RSSI reflects rel- 
ative received signal strength in a wireless environment, in 
arbitrary units. Specifically, RSSI is an indication of the power 
level observed by a radio hardware while receiving a data 
frame. Remember that the evaluated RSSI includes the power 
from adjacent channel interference, thermal noise, etc. that 
could affect the signal received. In order to measure the RSSI 
we have used dBm (also known as dBmW), which is an abbre- 
viation for the power ratio in decibels (dB) of the measured 
power referenced to one milliwatt (mW). 
The feasibility of V2V communications evaluated during 
the dynamic experiments was analyzed in terms of three dif- 
ferent QoS communication metrics: 
• The end-to-end delay (E2ED), which is the time taken for 
a packet to reach the destination node (in milliseconds). 
This includes all possible delays introduced by interme- 
diate nodes. Eq. 2 describes the E2ED incurred for any 
packet (pi) that has been correctly delivered. 
E2EDpi = arrive_timepi − transmission_timepi 
(2) 
• The packet delivery ratio (PDR), which refers to the ratio 
between the packets successfully delivered to the number 
of packets that have been sent by a source node (see 3). 
PDR =       number_of _packets_delivered  × 100%     
number_of _packets_sent 
 
(3) 
• The transmission data rate (TDR), which provides the 
amount of useful data successfully moved from one 
VANET node to another at a given time. In this study, the 
TDR is given in kilobytes per second (KB/s). 
Now, we present the results on the four aforementioned 
metrics (transmission power plus QoS).

5.2. VANET nodes transmission power results 
 
In general, the specifications of wireless interfaces given by 
the manufacturers provide values in ideal situations, 
therefore, we want to evaluate the Wi-Fi signal strength of the 
three devices studied here in real outdoor situations. As the 
experiments were carried out in the street on a normal road, 
the signal propagation was affected by different kinds of 
obstacles. Thus we offer the average of the signal strength 
sensed for 15 s. 
The transmission power is important in wireless com- 
munications since it determines different aspects of the 
performance of the node in the network. Increasing the 
transmission power, not only increases the effective cover- 
age and reduces the attenuation rate, but it also generates 
a greater amount of noise [32]. Thus, the most eﬃcient 
transmission power is diﬃcult to determine because of the 
combination of these positive and negative effects. However, 
empirical studies have demonstrated from an application 
point of view that the greater the signal strength received the 
better the PDR [33]. 
The experimental results are summarized in Fig. 9, which 
shows the average signal strength sensed at a given point for 
each studied device. The shaded area represents the lowest 
receiver sensitivities for which a receiver can correctly de- 
code frames for most of IEEE 802.11g-based wireless devices 
(signal strengths between −90 dBm and −80 dBm). 
As a first conclusion, the RSSI decreases with the distance 
between the node (device) that generates the signal and the 
measurement point (see Fig. 9). At the same time, we observe 
that, even if we have measured the signal strength for 15 s to 
limit the negative effects over the signal propagation in real 
outdoor scenarios, the values still show some irregular 
behavior. Our explanation for this phenomenon is that the 
RSSI includes the received power of the interference, thermal 
noise, etc. that has affected the possible regular behavior of 
such metric. 
The smartphone is the least competitive device in terms of 
RSSI results. The signal strength values for this device are 
between −90 dBm and −80 dBm from 60 m to 75 m, which 
means that its performance in transmitting informa- tion 
could suffer from a degradation at these distances. After 75 
m, the RSSI is lower than −90 dBm, and therefore, smart- 
phones barely have the capacity to exchange data streams at 
greater distances. 
The strength of the signal produced by the tablet is higher 
than −70 dBm for distances lower than 67.5 m. After that, 
from this point until 127.5 m, the strength of the signal 
decreases but it maintains values greater than −80 dBm. 
Thus, tablets may offer competitive communication perfor- 
mances at distances up to 127.5 m. Finally, when the dis- 
tance is greater than 127.5 m the signal strength is lower than 
−80 dBm, but always higher than −90 dBm, which means that 
the tablet signal strength is over the lowest sensitiv- 
ity threshold of IEEE 802.11g wireless based communications 
throughout our experiments. 
The best results in terms of signal strength are pro- 
vided by the laptop when using both PHY/MAC standards, IEEE 
802.11a and IEEE 802.11g. On the one hand, when IEEE 
802.11a is used, the received signal strength is significantly 
higher than in the other devices. The main reason is that the 
antenna gain is higher on the 5 GHz band than on the 
2.4 GHz. In this case, the RSSI is lower than −60 dBm just 
when the distance is longer than 90 m and the lowest mea- 
sured signal strength is −70.29 dBm (see Fig. 9). On the other 
hand, when the radio used in the laptop is configured with 
IEEE 802.11g, the RSSI results when the distance is lower than 
67.5 m are surprisingly close to the ones obtained by 
the 
tablet. From this point until the furthest one the signal 
strength is always higher than −80 dBm. 
Therefore, the best results in terms of transmission power 
are achieved by the laptop when transmitting on the 5 GHz 
band The second best are achieved when the same device 
uses the 2.4 GHz band. The third best RSSI is shown by the 
tablet, allowing interesting competitive results compared to 
the laptop for the complete experimentation (RSSI higher 
than −90 dBm). The lowest signal strength results are pre- 
sented by the smartphone (as expected): so after 75 m the 
experimental results are lower than −90 dBm, offering an 
undesirable behavior. Applications needing more than 75 m 
would probably not rely on smartphone’s Wi-Fi, with the im- 
portant exception of V2I, e.g., exchanging information to Wi- 
Fi spots and traﬃc lights in the city. We must also mention 
that, even if these results were expected, we are here quanti- 
fying the distance ranges and communication power of reg- 
ular smartphones, something diﬃcult to find in the related 
literature. 
Finally, note that, although the signal strength decreases 
with the distance for all devices and frequency bands, the re- 
duction is smoother and the signal strength is more stable 
when the radio used the 5 GHz band. This happens because 
the 2.4 GHz frequency band is way more crowded than the 
5 GHz one, and therefore, the devices on the 2.4 GHz suffer 
much more interference than those on the 5 GHz. 
 
 
5.3. VANET communication feasibility experimental results 
 
In this section, we present the experimental results, an- 
alyzing the exchange of data between the two moving vehi- 
cles by evaluating the three metrics presented in Section 5.1: 
E2ED, PDR, and TDR. 
The delivery delay results are shown in Table 1 in terms of 
the average E2ED in milliseconds (ms) of each data type and 
for each one of the seven V2V communication schemes an- 
alyzed in this study. The results are grouped by the distance 
between the cars during the data transfers. The cases in 
which none of the data packets sent reached the destination

node due to the loss of connection between the nodes are 
shown in the table by a dash (-). 
In analyzing the E2ED results in Table 1, we have observed 
that the transmission times do not always grow with the 
node’s distance or size of data packet transmitted. For in- 
stance, the average delay of sph-sph-25m (116 ms) is longer 
than that of sph-sph-50m (101.4 ms), even though the nodes 
were closer in the first case. Another example is the E2ED 
in sph-laptG-75m test, the delay exchanging packets with 
32 bytes of data (15.1 ms) is longer than the ones transmit- 
ting bigger data packets. 
Our explanation is that the experiments are carried out 
on an open road. Thus, as shown in Fig. 7.b, sometimes there 
are real world obstacles, i.e., different numbers of vehicles on 
the road. Also, wireless technologies sharing the same fre- 
quency band and operating in the same environment often 
interfere with each other, causing severe decreases in perfor- 
mance [34]. During our experiments, a number of other IEEE 
802.11bg wireless networks appeared in our surroundings. 
All these issues negatively affecting the ideal performance of 
the wireless communications. This phenomenon is notable 
and reinforces the importance of this analysis: if we had been 
using a simulator these situations would not have been prop- 
erly studied. 
According to the results in Table 1, the communica- 
tions that involve just smartphones spend the longest

transmission times. Specifically, the longest average E2ED 
occurs when data is exchanged by vehicles equipped with 
smartphones separated by a distance of 75 m(sph-sph-75m 
test) and exchanging packets of 128 bytes (in this case the 
E2ED is 1042.0 ms). This time is longer than the times spent 
when smartphones exchanged packets of 256 and 512 bytes 
of data which is not an expected behavior. As we discussed 
above, this is due to the real world interactions negatively 
affect the ideal performance of the wireless communications. 
After 75 m, the smartphones lose the connection with each 
other. Remember that the RSSI of the smartphones after 75 m

The shortest transmission delays are observed when the 
packet exchanges are carried out between the vehicles 
equipped with laptops and wireless interfaces configured 
with the IEEE 802.11g standard. Indeed, the E2ED using such 
devices is between ten times and a hundred times shorter 
than the ones measured when the nodes are equipped with 
other kinds of devices. The average E2ED achieved during 
laptG-laptG tests is 2.2 ms. 
Note that, although the RSSI results obtained by the lap- 
top configured with IEEE 802.11a standard are more compet- 
itive than the ones obtained when using IEEE 802.11g, the 
laptA-laptA test E2ED delays are significantly longer than the 
laptG-laptG ones. The is principally because the performance 
of the network is more likely to be negatively affected by real 
world obstacles when it uses a higher frequency [35]. 
Table 2 summarizes the results of the entire experiment by 
showing the average and the relative standard deviation of 
the three metrics studied. The results are grouped by dis- 
tances between the nodes (medium distance and long distance 
experiments). It also presents the global (average) results for 
the complete dynamic experiments set. 
According to the results in Table 2, the communications 
in the testbed scenario in which both nodes are equipped 
with tablets (tab-tab tests) require longer E2ED than the sce- 
nario in which one node uses a smartphone and the other 
uses a tablet (sph-tab tests). This is not the expected behav- 
ior because the smartphone signal strength is lower than the 
one of the tablet (see Section 5.2), and therefore, our smart- 
phone should show worse wireless communication capabil- 
ities than our tablets. The same occurs when we compare 
the E2ED of the tab-laptG and the sph-laptG tests. This can 
be explained by the road traﬃc density growth during the 
experiments with tablets (tab-tab and tab-laptG). Thus, the 
data transfers suffer from the existence of obstacles between 
the nodes. 
Taking into account just the experiments carried out by 
using two laptops, we can observe that the average E2ED 
during the laptA-laptA tests is longer than ten times the 
E2ED during the laptG-laptG tests. This difference is signifi- 
cantly greater if we take into account just the average E2ED 
during the long distance tests (E2ED laptA-laptA=156.01 ms 
and laptG-laptG=3.06 ms). Thus, the IEEE 802.11g standard is 
more promising than the IEEE 802.11a to perform competi- 
tive vehicular communications. 
The variability of the communications generated by the 
obstacles can be observed in the standard deviation of the 
E2ED results in Table 2. The largest deviation value, which 
means the lowest robustness, is obtained by the laptop

communicating on the 5 GHz band. Moreover, as the road 
traﬃc increased during the experiments involving the tablets, 
the tab-tab and the tab-laptG transmissions pre- sented larger 
deviation values than the sph-tab and the sph- laptG ones, 
respectively. 
Figs. 10 and 11 summarize the experimental results in 
terms of PDR and TDR, respectively, grouped by the distances 
between the VANET nodes. Note that, in both figures, some 
bars that represent the results of sph-sph, sph-tab, and laptA- 
laptA tests do not appear because there has been no data in- 
formation exchange due to the complete loss of communica- 
tion, as it can be seen in Table 2. 
Analyzing the quantity of the successfully delivered data 
packets, we observe two clearly differentiated behaviors. On 
the one hand, all the VANET communications studied be- 
tween devices that used the IEEE 802.11g standard (smart- 
phones, tablets, and laptops) present similar and competitive 
results (PDR above 80%) for the scenarios in which the vehi- 
cles are separated by medium distance (see Table 2). However, 
only communications that involve laptops maintain such a 
high performance (PDR above 85%) when the distance passes 
beyond 100 m (long distance). On the other hand, when the 
vehicles exchanged data by using laptops configured with the 
IEEE 802.11a standard, the communications showed a limited 
performance since the PDR results were always below 50%. 
However, these nodes were not able to perform any data ex- 
change when they were separated for distances greater than 
100 m. 
Taking into account just data transfers between smart- 
phones (sph-shp), during the medium distance experiments,

the nodes successfully deliver 100% of the packets when the 
vehicles are separated by 25 m and 50 m, and then, its PDR 
decreases below 50% at 75 m (see sph-sph in Fig. 10) and, in 
the long distance ones, they do not exchange any packets at all 
(PDR=0%). Globally, the average PDR in this case is 45% with 
a relative deviation of 111%. In turn, the sph-tab experiments 
present similar PDR results (average PDR is 81.33% in medium 
distance and 0% in long distance experiments). 
When both vehicles use tablets for the communications 
(tab-tab experiments), the PDR maintains a high perfor- 
mance in medium distance: 100.00%, 95.80%, and 88.66% 
when vehicles are separated by 25 m, 50 m, and 75 m, respec- 
tively. After that, when the distance between the vehicles is 
up to 125 m, they successfully exchange more than 40% of the 
packets. However, when the distance increases to 150 m, the 
PDR decreases to 12.20%. 
Laptops transferred the highest amount of data between 
each other transmitting on the 2.4 GHz band (see PDR Table 
2). The average PDR for the laptG-laptG communica- tions 
is 98.45% in medium distance and 94.45% in long dis- tance. 
In any case, the global average PDR is higher than 90% for all 
tests in which at least one of the communication nodes is 
equipped with a laptop and is using the IEEE 802.11g stan- 
dard (see Table 2). 
This is in sharp contrast to the results achieved by the same 
devices (laptops) when they communicate using IEEE 802.11a. 
The amount of delivered data are 40.76% and 8.67% for 
medium distance and long distance, respectively. In turn, the 
effective transmission range is shorter for the IEEE 
802.11a communications than for the IEEE 802.11g ones. The 
main reason for this is that both standards use the same 
modulation (OFDM) and IEEE 802.11a transmits on higher 
frequencies (5 GHz over 2.4 GHz), reducing its communica- 
tion capabilities against IEEE 802.11g [36,37]. 
In terms of transmission data rates, there are considerable 
differences between the laptG-laptG communications and the 
other VANET communications studied here (see Table 2 and 
Fig. 11). 
Smartphones have the least competitive results in terms of 
TDR. In the sph-sph and sph-tab experiments, the nodes are 
able to exchange data in just medium distance scenarios by 
achieving average data rates of 1.99 KB/s and 7.46 KB/s, re- 
spectively. Although it seems a poor performance, the TDRs 
achieved for distances between 25 and 75 m are enough to 
deploy VANET applications for exchanging lightweight warn- 
ing messages and traﬃc information with vehicles nearby and 
with the authorities via V2I. 
When smartphones communicate with a node equipped 
with a laptop, the performance of the communications dra- 
matically improves the TDR and the effective communication 
range. In sph-laptG experiments our nodes are able to ex- 
change data in medium distance and long distance tests with 
an average TDR of 18.26 KB/s and 17.60 KB/s, respectively (see 
Table 2). 
Tablets offer better TDR results than smartphones since 
tab-tab experiments achieve higher rates (its global average 
TDR 2.51 KB/s) and communicate with nodes at greater dis- 
tances (up to 125 m). However, when one of the nodes is 
equipped with a laptop this does not hold true. The sph-laptG 
tests obtained more competitive TDR results than tab-laptG 
ones (global average TDRs, sph-laptG=17.60 KB/s and tab- 
laptG=14.08 KB/s). This is due to the increase in road traﬃc 
during the test that involved vehicles equipped with tablets, 
which negatively affected the communications.

Taking into account the experiments carried out by trans- 
ferring data by using laptops configured with the IEEE 
802.11a standard, the performance is significantly different 
for both medium distance and long distance. When the dis- 
tance is shorter or equal to 75 m, these communications 
achieved a competitive transmission data rate (average TDR 
laptA-laptA=13.80 KB/s). However, the TDR drops to 0.44 KB/s 
for long distance tests. 
As in the previously analyzed metrics, in the analysis of 
the data rates, the best results are achieved when the two 
VANET nodes use laptops using IEEE 802.11g to exchange 
data between each other. In the medium distance experiments 
the average laptG-laptG TDR is 128.53 KB/s and in the long dis- 
tance ones the average TDR is 72.86 KB/s (see Table 2). These 
competitive transmission data rates may allow the exchange 
of multimedia information between the nodes, such as voice 
messages and videos. It is important to remark that this high 
TDR is achieved in distances up to 150 m. 
Summarizing, the best TDR results are presented by com- 
munications using two laptops configured with the IEEE 
802.11g standard (laptG-laptG). Then, the second and third 
best TDRs involved laptops too, sph-laptG and tab-laptG, re- 
spectively. These results clearly show that having a laptop in 
the communication loop makes smartphones and tablets us- 
able over greater distances and in more diﬃcult scenarios. 
This could be explained by the high sensitivity of the wireless 
interface used by the laptop. The other connections studied 
offered transmission rates between 2 KB/s and 8 KB/s. 
Broadly speaking, globally analyzing the feasibility of the 
communications carried out on the 2.4 GHz band in terms of 
the three evaluated metrics (E2ED, PDR, and TDR), vehicles 
equipped with laptops offer a practical solution for deploy- 
ing VANETs right away, because this solution allows commu- 
nications at distances greater than 150 m with the largest 
PDR and TDR and the lowest E2ED. This is not an unexpected 
behavior because the laptops are equipped with the highest 
gain antenna that is placed outside the car (see Fig. 2.c), mak- 
ing the laptops communications free from the signal loss due 
to the required effort of signals to penetrate inside the car 
when tablets or smartphones are used. Analyzing the per- 
sonal devices, both present competitive QoS and so could 
deploy useful VANETs with applications that do not require 
large transmission data rates. At the same time, tablets pro- 
vided an effective communication coverage over 125 m, and 
smartphones a coverage up to 75 m. These relatively low per- 
formance results dramatically improve when devices with 
powerful wireless interfaces, such as laptops, are included in 
the VANET communication loop. 
Note that, even the results obtained when the radios used 
the 5 GHz band are less competitive, the IEEE 802.11p-based 
communications are still considered as a promising tech- 
nology for vehicular environments. This standard provides 
several improvements that make it more robust than IEEE 
802.11a. An example of the changes described in its draft is 
the reduction of the bandwidth of the channels from 20 MHz 
of IEEE 802.11a to 10 MHz of IEEE 802.11p, which duplicates 
the transmission time for a specific data symbol, allowing the 
receiver to better cope with the characteristics of the radio 
channel in vehicular environments [38]. 
Finally, the importance of these outdoor testbeds is no- 
table, because some of our experiments have suffered from 
the existence of real world obstacles producing a decrease in 
the performance of the wireless communications, leading to 
far from ideal results. 
 
6. Conclusions 
 
Widely available smartphones and tablets provide a set 
of facilities, which are required by VANET applications. Thus, 
they can be used to deploy VANETs even if specific on-board 
units are not available to most road users. 
In this study, we have analyzed the use of smartphones, 
tablets, and laptops in vehicle-to-vehicle communications by 
defining a testbed carried out in the city of Málaga. In our 
analysis we have included two different MAC/PHY specifica- 
tions: the widely used IEEE 802.11g and the IEEE 802.11a. We 
have designed two different types of experiments: the first 
designed to evaluate the wireless signal strength generated by 
the analyzed devices, and the second, focused on charac- 
terizing the QoS of V2V communications of these devices. In 
light of the analysis of our experimentation we can conclude 
that: 
• In terms of signal strength, the best results were pro- 
vided by the laptops with competitive RSSI for distances 
greater than 150 m. The best (the highest RSSI) is the lap- 
top equipped with the radio using IEEE 802.11a and the 
second best is the same device utilizing IEEE 802.11g. The 
third ranked is the tablet with RSSI values are close to the 
ones obtained by the laptop transmitting on the 2.4 GHz 
band until the distance grew to 135 m. The least compet- 
itive device in terms of signal strength is the smartphone, 
but the RSSI maintained promising values for distances 
up to 75 m. 
• According to the network feasibility obtained for the de- 
vices using the IEEE 802.11g standard, the smartphones 
allowed useful information to be exchanged with nearby 
nodes in urban areas. The tablets improved the smart- 
phones’ communication capabilities and could be used to 
exchange more information, also on highways. Finally, the 
laptops were able to exchange multimedia information 
(audio and video) with the highest data rates and with 
any kind of communication partner node (smartphones, 
tablets, and other laptops) at distances up to 150 m. 
• The network feasibility when the laptops exchanged in- 
formation with radios configured with the IEEE 802.11a 
standard were significantly less competitive than when 
they utilized IEEE 802.11g. They provided shorter effective 
communication range (up to 100 m), longer transmission 
delays, and lower transmission data rates. 
It should be taken into account that the performance of 
communications has not always followed the regular ex- 
pected behavior. This can be explained by the variability of 
the road traﬃc density (vehicles act as obstacles for the signal 
propagation) and by the existence of a number of other IEEE 
802.11 wireless networks that interfered with the signal of 
our VANET. This kind of behavior, which influences the radio 
signal propagation, and therefore the communications QoS, 
is quite diﬃcult to accurately represent and evaluate in simu- 
lators or emulators. Therefore, performing real world tests is 
strongly recommended to evaluate vehicular networks, even if 
it is diﬃcult to master when conducting such experiments.

As a matter for future work, we plan to extend our 
testbed by including IEEE 802.11p experiments, as soon as 
we are able to find affordable devices on the market. At the 
same time, we are designing new outdoor experiments to 
evaluate VANETs performance, using more than two vehicles 
with different mobility models and taking into account 
different available routing and broadcasting approaches. 
Finally, we will define new testbeds by using other kinds of 
communication schemes such as V2I, in-vehicle, and cellular 
communications.
