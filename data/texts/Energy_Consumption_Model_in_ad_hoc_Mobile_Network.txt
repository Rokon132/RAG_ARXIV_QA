ABSTRACT 
The aim 
of 
this 
work is 
to 
model the nodes 
battery 
discharge 
in wireless 
ad 
hoc 
networks. Many work focus on the energy consumption in such networks. Even, the research in the 
highest layers of the ISO model, takes into account the energy consumption and efficiency. Indeed, the 
nodes that form such network are mobiles, so no instant recharge of battery. Also with special type of ad 
hoc networks are wireless sensors networks using non-rechargeable batteries. All nodes with an 
exhausted battery are considered death and left the network. To consider the energy consumption, in this 
work we model using a  Markov chain, the discharge of the battery considering  of instant activation and 
deactivation distribution function of these nodes.

1. INTRODUCTION 
Wireless ad hoc networks open various research perspectives since the posed constraints. 
Various proposed protocols in these complex networks that aim to reduce energy consumption 
or achieve self-configuration and self-organization. In addition messages sent must reach in real 
time accordingly to the applications nature of these networks. 
Nodes are generally composed by embedded devices, with limited resources, autonomous, able 
to process information and transmit using radio waves, to another entity (sensors, processing 
unit, PDA...) over a limited distance. Ad hoc networks are generally composed by a large 
number of mobiles nodes, forming a large network without an established infrastructure. 
Therefore, the nodes act as transmitter, receiver, and data router at the same time. 
Communications networks are used for various applications. Designing a network, it is 
necessary to evaluate its performances in order to correctly dimension its operations and 
capacity. Indeed, the evolution of these performances compares different network topologies 
according to their uses. It also allows the estimation of network behaviour in many situations, 
and in particular to estimate the operational problems and solve them before implementation. To 
evaluate the performances, then, we can use an analogy with a similar already existing network, 
use a network simulator or through analytical methods of verification. The networks simulators 
represent the advantage of uselessness of having existing networks. Another method of 
performances evolution of communications networks is the analytical analyses and formal 
verification. There are several evaluations methods using mathematical tools such as Petri nets 
[1], [2], [3], [4] or Markov chains [5], [6], [7]. The two methods present many limits with the 
modern complex system. Currently we would perform a model combining probabilistic and 
temporal aspect, to model a probabilistic systems variable in time. These two models (Petri and 
Markov chains) cannot provide a modelling formalism that satisfies these automata. To resolve 
these problems the researcher, analyses this complex system with model checking [8], [9]. This 
is a group of techniques for automatic verification [10] of dynamic system, since the varying of 
the system behaviour in time. Then it is important to express the timing and the probability in 
the same time. 
To prefer the energy efficiency in mobile ad hoc networks, it is necessary to model the node 
energy consumption. In this work, our aim is to model the batteries power discharge, in ad hoc 
wireless networks. Our proposition is to use the IPP based ON /OFF model (Interrupted Poisson 
Process).This model is much used in various types of network to traffic modelling [11-18], even 
the use of such model in IEEE802.11 [19], have the aim to express the traffic control and not 
the energetic behaviour. 
This paper is organized as follows:  In Section 2, we present our motivation. We discuss the 
related work in section 3. The section 4 presents the stochastic modeling technics. In section 5 
we present our proposition to model battery with ON/OFF model, and then we calculate the 
distribution probability function and the battery charge average.  We conclude this paper and 
present the future work in section 6. 
2. MOTIVATION: 
A Mobile Ad-hoc Network (MANETs) [1] is a collection of nodes or terminals that 
communicate together by forming a multi-hop radio network. The nodes can move and their 
network topology may be dynamic.  
In such network, there is no centralized administration. Each node can join the network or it 
leave at any time. Generally to ensure the mobility of nodes, we cannot recharge the battery.  A 
node with an exhausted battery is considered dead and not usable. 
In recent work [20] we presented an efficient routing method using energy efficiency 
parameters. With the exchange of considerable number of control messages to establishment of 
routes, or a data messages, this exhaust resources and aggravates performances. One of major 
causes of exchange of these message is the lost of paths, result of the exhausting of a node 
battery. To overcome this problem, we suppose that all nodes composed the networks have 
information about the energy stored in the batteries of its neighborhood. It avoid the routing 
using a node that it battery will be exhausted. 
 Precisely, a node uses at the same time the shortest selected path using Dijekstra [21] and also 
the residual battery energy in message routing. We therefore, proposed a new mechanism to 
send HELLO message with a reactive routing protocol (Ad hoc On-demand Distance Vector 
AODV [22], [23]) in calculated instant proportionally to the battery residual energy.  Our 
proposition does not change the message fields, just with the sending instant we can extract the 
energy information. Reached the destination, calling the inverse function, it updates the 
neighbourhood energy base.  
Through this information, a routing protocol avoids the use of a shortest path that is composed 
by a node with an exhausted battery.  
 
 
3. RELATED WORK: 
Given the growing importance of energy consumption in wireless networks, over the last few 
years, a number of works have proposed ways to improve energy efficiency and have modelled 
the terminals batteries in a wireless and wired network. So, in this context we present an 
overview on the batteries modelling, on the first hand, and the probabilistic model applied in 
wireless and wired networks. 
In [35] the authors present the battery lifetime modelling using three different methods, the 
three models are used to predict the acid battery lifetime and look for means to extend it using 
numerical results.  
In [24] and in their thesis report [25] M. R. Jongerden and B.R. Haverkort studied the mobile 
devices battery. Starting with a presentation of the chemical and electronic design, the authors 
express values of the charge and discharge procedures. Through an analytical study, they 
present in a second part the lifetime prediction of a battery using the Rakhmatov Vrudhila 
model [26]. This latter presents the diffusion process of the active material in the battery. In the 
third part of the former, the authors present the Kinetic Battery Model [27], [28], [29] it called 
such name because it uses a chemical kinetics process as its basis. The final part of [24] present 
the stochastic model using the Chiasserini and Rao [30], [31], [32], [33], that use the discrete 
time Markov chain to model battery. The different states used in this model represent the 
numbers of charge units. In the last section, authors use the stochastic modified KiBaM [34] 
using discrete time transient Markov process. 
Our work is similar to this model. The difference is that our model does not present the N states 
as charge unit, but we use the two states of the node ON/OFF. 
4. STOCHASTIC MODELLING: 
The Markov chains [5], [6], [7] form a mathematical formalism to analyze a stochastic 
phenomenon. A model is based on states and transitions (transition rates or transition 
probability). Its simple structure allows modelling of a large class of systems. The Markov 
chains are well known tools which allow many theoretical results finely analyze the behaviour 
of the modelled system. The Markov chains are one of the most important tools for analysis of 
random processes in the area. As part of a modelling and performance evaluation, Markov 
chains have a simplicity and efficiency essential. 
There are two major types of stochastic Markov chains with discrete time, in which time is 
considered discrete, consisting of a finite number of independent state, and continuous-time 
chain, formed by infinite state dependent and related. The states are the representation of 
random processes in time. Assume that the system transits from state i to state j with probability 
Pij that depends only on states i and j. Such a system is called without memory or Markovian, 
which means that the probability Pij does not depend on previous states i in which the system is 
passed over in its history. 
To adapt a wide range of systems, we can use a Poisson process modulated by a Markov chain. 
The states are based on the intensity (λ) of a Markov chain. These processes are grouped under 
the acronym MMPP (Markov Modulated Poisson Process) [36]. An M-MMPP is an MMPP 
with M states. 
The marginal distribution of MMPP is a combination of Poisson distributions. And its 
covariance is a weighted sum of exponentials. The model parameters are more important since 
we use with the transition matrix of the Markov chain, a new diagonal matrix denoted by Ʌ, 
containing the intensities associated with different states is necessary. 
 
 
 
Figure 1.ON/OFF model: Markov chain with two states 
ON-OFF model is a special case of MMPP and IPP (Interrupted Poisson Process). The Markov 
chain modulating the Poisson process has two states: ON and OFF, which correspond to two 
values of the intensity of a Poisson process (known as ON-OFF model because often in the off 
state intensity is zero). In addition to the 2x2 matrix of transition, this model requires two new 
parameters: 
λon and λoff, which correspond to the respective intensities of the Poisson process in the ON 
and OFF states (see Figure.1). This model thus has four parameters (λon = (1-λ), λoff = (1-µ), λ, 
µ where λ and µ present respectively the transition probability from ON to OFF and from OFF 
to ON). 
ON-OFF models are used to model the alternation of two phases or modes of communication 
with different characteristics. This allows reproducing some intermittency, which is a very 
important characteristic of traffic because it has a significant impact on performance. 
In our modelling we will use this model to modulate the alternation between active and inactive 
state of a network nodes. 
5. BATTERY ON/OFF MODELLING  
5.1. Discharge Function  
As mentioned in Section 2, we used the prediction of the battery usage of nodes that compose 
ad hoc networks in order to calculate optimal routes using as metrics energy and hop count. The 
model is well detailed in a previous work [20].  
To complete the model we started from continuous distribution of battery power level presented 
in figure .2 According to [35].

5.2. Analytical model and Numerical results 
In the real case, the curve shown in figure .1 is more accurate, since, there are times 
when the battery is inactive. By modeling the battery using the ON-OFF model, we will 
have a moment that no charge and no discharge of the battery as shown in figure .3.

For the sake of simplicity, and without going far of reality, if we consider a battery with 
a standard activation duration D, in a normal conditions, the terminal using this battery 
will shut down after a duration D. However, if we alternate between start and shutdown of 
components, the nominal duration of battery will decrease. This can be translating by 
the both figure 4. and figure 5. The probability of operating of battery will increase if 
we decrease the number of alternation between activation and inactivation 
(
λ
µ −

=1).  Indeed, if this term decreases, T (the sum of activation periods) 
increase, and the battery duration will be near of D. 
 
3. CONCLUSIONS 
The power consumption of mobiles devices presents an important challenge in academic and 
industrial research. Much research has been done on decreasing the average power consumption 
of these devices.  In this approach, the aim is to reduce the energy consumption by selective 
start or shutdown of components. However, in most of the research the battery is only 
considered as a limited-power source. Alteration between the active and inactive, and increased 
consumption due to state change are not taken into consideration. 
In a routing algorithm, we proposed a routing of messages according to the level of the nodes 
batteries forming the path. The shortest and safest path according to battery charge nodes that 
form will be elected. To know the battery level of different nodes, the algorithm is to send 
HELLO messages in times depending on the level of the battery. The aim is to seek the function 
that reduces the maximum probability to have collision. The aim of this paper was to study the 
behavior of a nodes battery over a period T. Then, we chose as stochastic model Interrupt 
Poisson Processes IPP and especially the ON / OFF model. The calculation allows us to find a 
modeling of batteries. The variation and the calculation of averages favor the safety and 
correctness of our model. As future work, we will calculate the combined instant of sending 
messages and probability distributed function in order to find the right parameter and the 
optimal function that allows us to extract the battery level of a neighboring node, avoiding the 
collision.
