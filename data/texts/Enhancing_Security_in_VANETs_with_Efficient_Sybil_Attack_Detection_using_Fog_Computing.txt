Abstract—Vehicular ad hoc networks (VANETs) facilitate ve-
hicles to broadcast beacon messages to ensure road safety. Rogue
nodes in VANETs cause a Sybil attack to create an illusion of fake
trafﬁc congestion by broadcasting malicious information leading
to catastrophic consequences, such as the collision of vehicles.
Previous researchers used either cryptography, trust scores, or
past vehicle data to detect rogue nodes, but they suffer from
high processing delay, overhead, and false-positive rate (FPR).
We propose a fog computing-based Sybil attack detection for
VANETs (FSDV), which utilizes onboard units (OBUs) of all the
vehicles in the region to create a dynamic fog for rogue nodes
detection. We aim to reduce the data processing delays, overhead,
and FPR in detecting rogue nodes causing Sybil attacks at high
vehicle densities. The performance of our framework was carried
out with simulations using OMNET++ and SUMO simulators.
Results show that our framework ensures 43% lower processing
delays, 13% lower overhead, and 35% lower FPR at high vehicle
densities compared to existing Sybil attack detection schemes.

I. INTRODUCTION
Vehicular ad hoc networks (VANETs) have been emerging
as a promising solution to intelligent transportation systems
(ITS) with an aim to enhance road safety by reducing the
number of road accidents and regulating trafﬁc ﬂow. In
VANETs, the vehicles can communicate with each other using
vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) and vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I)
techniques, depends on dedicated short range communication
(DSRC) [1]. The vehicles are equipped with on-board units
(OBUs) for transmitting and receiving the messages between
vehicles and between vehicles and the roadside units (RSUs).
VANETs facilitate vehicles to broadcast beacon messages
to disseminate network state or emergency information [2].
However, malicious vehicles, also known as rogue nodes may
cause a Sybil attack to create an illusion of trafﬁc congestion
in order to reroute other honest nodes in the network to trap it
or to cause catastrophic consequences, such as the collision of
vehicles [3]. Therefore, efﬁcient detection of the rogue nodes
causing a Sybil attack is crucial in containing network damage
and establishing a secure VANETs environment.
Previous authors used either cryptography, trust scores,
or past vehicle data to detect rogue nodes. Baza et al. [4]
presented an intrusion detection system (IDS) to detect rogue
nodes based on the power of works (PoW) algorithm. Each
vehicle starts the trajectory by transmitting the vehicle data
using the public key and the signature using the private key
to the RSUs. The RSUs verify the trajectory of the vehicles
based on the historical vehicle data. If multiple trajectories
for the same vehicle exists, the corresponding vehicle will
be considered a rogue, and the information of the rogue
node will be broadcasted to all vehicles in the region. The
proposed scheme [4] suffers from a high delay and overhead
in encrypting and decrypting the vehicle data. Zaidi et al. [5]
proposed an IDS, where each vehicle utilizes its OBU to detect
false data propagated by the rogue nodes based on the past
vehicle data. Ayaida et al. [6] proposed a trust model (TM) to
detect false messages in VANETs based on the correctness
of the data broadcasted in beacon messages. However, [5,
6] cannot be used in high vehicle dense regions, such as
Manhattan and other downtown regions, due to high packet
loss ratio (PLR) and false-positive rate (FPR).
To address the limitations of the existing Sybil attack
detection schemes, we propose a fog computing-based Sybil
attack detection for VANETs (FSDV). The FSDV framework
employs the concept of guard nodes. The guard node is the
vehicle that has more neighboring vehicles in its transmission
range, dynamically creates a fog utilizing the OBUs of all
vehicles in the region, and then the dynamic fog is used to
analyze the received beacon messages from all vehicles to
detect rogue nodes. FSDV exploits a trafﬁc ﬂow phenomena
to generate a residual corresponding to the difference between
the actual speed of the guard node and the received speed
of the neighboring vehicles in a distributed way by using the
beacon messages broadcasted over the network. A signiﬁcant
deviation of this residual from a dynamic threshold is consid-
ered as an indicator of the Sybil attack. The selection of the
dynamic threshold directly impacts the Sybil attack detection
probability. Thus, the threshold has to be chosen properly in
order to well detect and to avoid false-positive detections. We
adopt the fog computing technique to detect rogue nodes,
as it offers low latency, low overhead, and high bandwidth
compared to traditional communication techniques [7].
The novelty of our proposed work lies in providing low data
processing delays and low FPR at high vehicle densities. In
addition, FSDV does not depend on any roadside infrastruc-
tures like RSUs or trust scores or past vehicle data in rogue
nodes detection. The difference between our framework and
existing schemes [4-6] is, each vehicle uses its OBU or RSU
to detect rogue nodes. RSUs are not uniquely deployed in all
VANETs regions. Moreover, the overloaded RSUs yields high
data processing delay and high FPR. OBUs of an individual
vehicle is highly resource-constrained encounters a high delay
in analyzing the data at high vehicle densities. Whereas, in
the FSDV, the guard node combines OBUs of all vehicles in

the region in creating the dynamic fog. Utilizing OBUs of all
vehicles increases the computational power of dynamic fog
resulting in low data processing delay and low FPR.
Our objective is to reduce the latency in detecting rogue
nodes and decrease FPR at high vehicle densities. We consid-
ered three existing rogue nodes detection schemes for compari-
son: PoW [4], IDS [5], and TM [6]. The performance of FSDV
was carried out using OMNET++ and SUMO simulators with
up to 4000 vehicles and 40% rogue nodes. Our results lead to
an exciting conclusion that our framework reduces the latency
and FPR, and performs up to 32% better than the existing
Sybil attack detection schemes [4-6].
The contributions of the paper are: 1) We proposed a
framework, FSDV, that uses fog computing technique to detect
Sybil attacks in VANETs with low delay and low FPR. 2) We
introduced the guard node in FSDV, which uses an OBU-based
fog computing technique to compare speed values received
in the beacon messages from all vehicles in the region. 3)
We performed an extensive simulation by creating a dynamic
fog layer under varying vehicular and network conditions to
determine false information broadcasted by rogue nodes.
The rest of the paper is structured as follows: related work
is discussed in Section II. The working principle of our
proposed work to detect rogue is illustrated in Section III.
The mathematical model analysis is discussed in Section IV.
Section V presents the performance evaluation of the proposed
framework. The simulation results are discussed in Section VI
before concluding the paper in Section VII.
II. RELATED WORK
This section presents an overview of the most recent existing
schemes that detect rogue nodes in VANETs. Arshad et al.
[8] and Ahamad et al. [9] proposed a trust-based scheme to
detect rogue nodes in VANETs. Based on the correctness of
the data in beacon messages, positive or negative trust values
are assigned. Positive and negative trust values represent the
normal and abnormal behavior of the vehicles, respectively.
When the calculated trust of any vehicle reaches a predeﬁned
threshold limit is known as a rogue node and then the
information is broadcasted to all the vehicles in the region.
Iwendi et al. [10] proposed a spider money technique, which
utilizes the RSUs in the region to authenticate the private
key associated with beacon messages to identify malicious
data broadcasted by the rogue nodes. Once the rogue nodes
are identiﬁed, the RSUs send rogue nodes information to
the department of motor vehicles (DMV) to withdraw the
vehicle’s permit to reduce the potential damage to the network.
However, the frameworks [8-10] encounter a low true-positive
rate (TPR) and high FPR in detecting rogue nodes.
Al-Otaibi et al. [11] presented a cryptography-based fog
computing scheme to detect rogue nodes in VANETs. The
RSUs are considered as fog nodes for rogue nodes detection.
However, this approach [11] encounters a high processing
delay and overhead in detecting rogue nodes when the RSUs
are overloaded in the region. Yang et al. [12] proposed a
machine-learning algorithm to classify the historical vehicle
data received from all the vehicles in the region. The result

fog computing technique.
of the classiﬁcation, i.e., whether the data received from the
vehicle is valid or not, are then combined to detect rogue nodes
broadcasted malicious information. However, this approach
[12] encounters high delay and high overhead.
To overcome the limitations of the existing Sybil attack de-
tection schemes [4-6, 8-12], we propose the FSDV framework,
which utilizes only vehicle speed values in beacon messages
and does not depend on either trust score, cryptography, or
past vehicle data in rogue nodes detection.
III. PROPOSED FSDV FRAMEWORK
In this section, we discuss the working principle of our
FSDV framework. The FSDV framework engages fog com-
puting in detecting rogue nodes involved in Sybil attacks.
The rogue nodes broadcast multiple messages with different
vehicle id to all vehicles in the region, thereby giving a false
impression of fake trafﬁc congestion ahead by lowering the
speed values in the beacon messages. One such scenario of
Sybil attacks is illustrated in Fig. 1.
In this paper, we employ the concept of guard node to
detect Sybil attacks in VANETs. The vehicle which has more
neighboring vehicles in its communication range will act as
a guard node. Guard node dynamically creates a fog utilizing
OBUs of all vehicles to detect rogue nodes broadcasting lower
speed values in the region. Once the fog layer is deployed,
the guard node starts adding the neighboring vehicles to
the list of neighbors, as met for the ﬁrst time. Otherwise,
it updates the timestamp of the neighboring vehicles. The
neighbors list updated continuously when the beacon messages
are broadcasted in the region (i.e., for every 100ms). Then,
the detection of rogue nodes is achieved by comparing and
analyzing the speed values broadcasted in beacon messages.
If the speed difference is greater than the dynamic threshold,
a Sybil attack is detected. This is due to all the vehicles in the
region broadcast similar speed values as they are in similar
trafﬁc conditions and dependent on other vehicles under all
circumstances. Thus, if there is a signiﬁcant difference in
vehicle speed, the guard node considers the vehicles as rogue
nodes. Otherwise, the vehicles are highlighted as honest nodes.
JOURNAL OF LATEX CLASS FILES, VOL. 14, NO. 8, AUGUST 2015
The guard node broadcasts the information of rogue nodes
to all vehicles in the region to ignore the beacon messages
received further from the rogue nodes to contain the network
damage. The adoption of fog computing increases the compu-
tation power of the guard node as the OBUs of all vehicles
are utilized in creating a dynamic fog results in lower data
processing delay compared to [4-6] schemes.
A. Selection of Guard Node
Rogue nodes are the vehicles broadcasting low-speed values
or sudden decrease in speed to change the normal behavior of
the vehicles for own beneﬁts. In the FSDV framework, the
guard node analyzes the speed values in the beacon messages
received from all vehicles in the region to detect rogue nodes.
The following two assumptions are made in the selection of the
guard node: First, we assume the center vehicle in the region
will act as a guard node (𝐺𝑛), as the vehicle in the center has
more number of the neighboring vehicles in its communication
range compared to the front and tail-end vehicles. Second, we
assume that the total number of vehicles (N) in the region at
any given time is at least two. The guard node needs at least
two vehicles in the region to compare and analyze the beacon
messages to detect rogue nodes causing a Sybil attack.
Initially, we take the mean of position vectors of all vehicles
(i.e., 𝑃𝑡1, 𝑃𝑡2, ...., 𝑃𝑡𝑁) to ﬁnd a unique center point 𝜁.
𝜁= 1
𝑁
𝑁
∑︁
𝑖=1
𝑃𝑡𝑖
(1)
We calculate Euclidean distance between 𝜁and the position
vector of each vehicle and then determine the point that has
the minimum distance from the 𝜁. Finally, the vehicle located
at this point will be selected as the guard node, 𝐺𝑛.
𝐺𝑛= arg min
𝑃𝑡𝑖∈𝑌∥𝜁−𝑃𝑡𝑖∥
(2)
Where, 𝑌= {𝑃𝑡1, 𝑃𝑡2....,𝑃𝑡𝑁}.
B. Density and Speed of Vehicles
In the FSDV framework, Greenshield’s trafﬁc ﬂow model is
used to calculate the speed of the guard node and the density
of the vehicles in the region. Greenshield trafﬁc model is
considered to be a fairly accurate and simple model for real-
world trafﬁc ﬂows works under the assumption of density (𝜌),
and the speed of the vehicles (S) is negatively correlated [5].
The density can be calculated as:
𝜌= 𝐵𝑚𝑠𝑔· 𝑁
(3)
Where, 𝐵𝑚𝑠𝑔is the beacon message received from one
vehicle id and 𝑁is the total number of vehicles in the
region. As the speed and density of the vehicles are negatively
correlated, the density increases when the speed of the vehicles
decreases in the region. The speed of the guard node (𝑆𝐺) can
be deﬁned as:
𝑆𝐺= 𝑆𝑚𝑎𝑥−
𝜌
𝜌𝑚𝑎𝑥
𝑆𝑚𝑎𝑥
(4)
Where 𝑆𝑚𝑎𝑥is the speed of the vehicle when density is zero
and 𝜌𝑚𝑎𝑥is the maximum density, also point at which speed of
the vehicles becomes zero. The calculated speed value of the
guard node (𝑆𝐺) is compared with the received speed values
of the neighboring vehicles (𝑆𝑟𝑐𝑣𝑑). If the difference in speed
values is greater than the dynamic threshold (𝑆𝑡ℎ), i.e., 𝑆𝐺
– 𝑆𝑟𝑐𝑣𝑑> 𝑆𝑡ℎ, a Sybil attack is detected, and the vehicle
broadcasted corresponding speed values is considered as a
rogue node. Thus, the guard vehicle broadcasts the information
of rogue nodes to all the vehicles in the region.

IV. MATHEMATICAL MODEL ANALYSIS
To validate the performance of the proposed approach,
discussed in Section III, we investigate in this section the
theoretical expression for the delay and the probability of
detecting the rogue nodes correctly in the Sybil attack.
A. Analysis of Delay in FSDV
As our objective is to reduce the latency signiﬁcantly in
detecting rogue nodes compared to [4-6] schemes, we have
analyzed different types of delays, such as communication
delay, queuing delay, and data processing delay associated
with the FSDV framework, illustrated in Section III. The
communication delay, 𝐷𝑐associated with the guard node in

transmitting the received beacon messages (𝐵𝑚𝑠𝑔) from all
vehicles in the region to the fog layer is given by:
𝐷𝑐= 𝑥
𝑟=

(5)
Where, 𝑥is the number of bits in the beacon messages, 𝑡
is the transmission power of fog devices at the fog layer, 𝑐is
the channel coefﬁcient between devices the guard node and the
fog layer, 𝜎2 is the power of white Gaussian noise, 𝑟is the
transmission rate calculated from Shannon channel capacity
theorem, and 𝑏is the bandwidth of the link established
between the guard node and the fog layer.
Devices associated with the fog layer use the M/M/1 queu-
ing model for preparing the beacon messages to be computed,
where the arrival and service time are represented as
𝜆1 and
𝜇1 , respectively. The queuing delay (𝐷𝑞) associated with a
fog layer of our FSDV framework is given by:
𝐷𝑞= 1 −1

The data processing delay (𝐷𝑝) indicates the required time

(7)
Where 𝑐𝑓𝑙is the computation capability of the fog layer, 𝑓
is the number of CPU cycles required for computing one bit of
data at the fog layer, and 𝑇𝐶(𝑥) is the time complexity for 𝑥
bits of data in the beacon messages, depends on the algorithm
discussed in Section III. The total delay (𝐷𝑡) of our FSDV
framework in the fog layer is given by:
𝐷𝑡= 𝐷𝑐+ 𝐷𝑞+ 𝐷𝑝
(8)
B. Rogue Nodes Veriﬁcation
Assume the beacon messages from all other vehicles in
the region are successfully received by the guard vehicle.
The probability of comparing the speed values in the beacon
messages to detect the rogue nodes correctly is given by:
𝑋(𝑃1𝑃+ 𝑃2𝑃)
(9)
The parameter 𝑃is the probability that beacon messages
positively reach the guard vehicle from all other vehicles in the
region. 𝑃1 represents the probability of predicting the honest
node correctly if the difference between the calculated speed
of the guard node and the honest node is lower than the
dynamic threshold (i.e., 𝑆𝐺– 𝑆𝑟𝑐𝑣𝑑< 𝑆𝑡ℎ). 𝑃2 represents
the probability of predicting the rogue node correctly if the
difference between the calculated speed of the guard node and
the rogue node is greater than the dynamic threshold (i.e., 𝑆𝐺
– 𝑆𝑟𝑐𝑣𝑑> 𝑆𝑡ℎ). 𝑋represents the probability that the guard
node successfully creates a dynamic fog layer to compare
and analyze the speed values in the beacon message to detect
the rogue nodes in the region. The probability of incorrectly
predicting the rogue nodes, 𝑃𝑖is given by:
𝑃𝑖= 1 −[𝑋𝑃1𝑃+ 𝑋𝑃2𝑃]
= 1 −[𝑋𝑃1 + 𝑋𝑃2]𝑃
≈1 −𝑋𝑃2𝑃
(10)
V. PERFORMANCE EVALUATION
This section evaluates and analyzes the performance of the
FSDV framework discussed in Section III.
A. Evaluation of Speed Threshold in FSDV
As discussed in Section III, a signiﬁcant deviation of the
speed values from a dynamic threshold (𝑆𝑡ℎ) is considered
as a Sybil attack. The threshold value is more dynamic as
it depends on the speed of the vehicles in the region. Thus,
when the speed of the vehicle decreases, the dynamic threshold
value also decreases in the region. For example, the dynamic
threshold value in the dense vehicle region, such as the
downtown region is lower, compared to the dynamic threshold
value in the ﬂuid trafﬁc region. This is due to the speed of
the vehicles in a high dense vehicle region is lower compared
to the ﬂuid trafﬁc region. The Fig. 2 shows how the selected
speed threshold 𝑆𝑡ℎimpacts the detection probability 𝑃𝑠𝑎.
From Fig. 2, we can infer that the probability of Sybil attack
detection is high when the speed threshold (𝑆𝑡ℎ) is low. This
is due to we were able to identify all the rogue nodes in
the region. However, the low-speed threshold may hide false
positive detection. When the speed threshold (𝑆𝑡ℎ) increases,
the detection probability decreases since we can miss some
rogue nodes due to the high-speed threshold. Therefore, to
detect all the rogue nodes in the region and to reduce FPR,
the speed threshold has to be chosen dynamically based on
the speed of the vehicles in the region.

B. Simulation Setup
The simulations are carried out using OMNET++ and
SUMO simulators. SUMO is an open-source trafﬁc-events
simulator, provides a trace of vehicle movements, such as
vehicle speed, position, acceleration, etc. at the end of every
simulation for a map imported from OpenStreetMap. OM-
NET++ is a discrete event simulator, used to measure the
performance of the network using the node deployment model,
node mobility model, etc. To perform the simulation, we
imported the map of the city of Norman, Oklahoma into the
SUMO simulator. The output of the SUMO simulator, i.e.,
the trace of vehicles, is given as input to the OMNET++
simulator for rogue nodes detection. To assess the scalability
and behavior of the FSDV framework, we increase the number
of vehicles up to 4000 and the presence of rogue nodes in the
network up to 40%. Table I summarizes the most commonly
used parameters used in the simulation.
C. Performance Metrics
The simulations were performed based on the equations
formulated in Section III and IV. We considered the following
metrics to evaluate the performance of our FSDV framework
and to compare our results with PoW, IDS, and TM schemes:
• Data processing time: The time needed by the guard node
to analyze the beacon messages received in the region.
• PLR: The ratio of the number of lost packets to the total
number of packets sent across a communication channel.
• Average throughput: Average rate of successfully broad-
casted beacon messages across a communication channel.
• Overhead: The additional information exchanged between
the vehicles to detect rogue nodes in the region.
• True positive rate: The percentage of rogue nodes is
accurately detected and classiﬁed as rogue nodes.
TPR = No. of rogue nodes detected correctly
Total no. of rogue nodes
(11)
• False positive rate: The percentage of honest nodes is
incorrectly detected and classiﬁed as rogue nodes.
FPR = No. of honest nodes detected incorrectly
Total no. of honest nodes
(12)
VI. RESULTS
During the simulation, the FSDV framework is analyzed
based on the equations formulated in Section III and Section
IV, and the performance metrics illustrated in Section V. The
results are presented below:
1) Data processing time: The time taken by the guard node
to process speed values in the received beacon messages (Eq.
7). When the number of vehicles increases from 500 to 4000,
the data processing time increases as the guard node needs
to process a large number of beacon messages received from
all the vehicles in the region. However, as the OBUs of all
vehicles are utilized in creating the dynamic fog layer, the
computation power of the guard node increases when the
number of vehicles increases in the region results in a 43%
lower processing delay compared to [4-6] schemes. In the 4000
vehicles simulation, the data processing time is 39%, 51%, and
54% lower than PoW, IDS, and TM schemes, respectively, as
shown in Fig. 3a. The results show that our FSDV framework
is efﬁcient and can handle high vehicle densities.
2) PLR: PLR of the FSDV framework increases when
the number of vehicles increases from 500 to 4000 due to
the high mobility of the vehicles resulting in a collision
of some packets. However, the PLR of our framework is
lower compared to [4-6] at all vehicle densities. The PLR is
calculated against the number of vehicles. In 4000 vehicles
simulation, PLR is 22%, 29%, and 38% lower than the PoW,
IDS, and TM schemes, respectively, as shown in Fig. 3b.
3) Average throughput: The average throughput is calculated
against the number of vehicles and increases when the number
of vehicles increases, as shown in Fig. 3c. Due to a large
number of messages are successfully broadcasted to all vehi-
cles region, the average throughput of the FSDV framework is
higher compared to [4-6] schemes at all vehicle densities. In
the 4000 vehicle simulation, average throughput is 14%, 15%,
and 19% higher than the PoW, IDS, and TM, respectively.
4) Overhead: The overhead of our framework is calculated
against the number of rogue nodes (Fig. 3d). Finding the
dynamic threshold increases the overhead of our framework
(Section V). However, the adoption of the fog computing tech-
nique yields lower network overhead compared to traditional
communication techniques. Thus, the overhead of the FSDV
framework is 13% lower compared to [4-6] schemes. For a
network with 40% rogue nodes, the overhead is 7%, 6%, and
10% lower than the PoW, IDS, and TM schemes, respectively.
5) TPR: It is difﬁcult to detect the rogue nodes broadcasting
false information if the speed varies gradually in the received
beacon messages. However, to generate either fake trafﬁc
congestion or accident, the target rogue node decreases the
speed values quickly. Therefore, our FSDV framework detects
rogue nodes correctly (i.e.,100%) up to 30% rogue nodes in
the region and decreases slightly to 98.7% when the number of
rogue nodes increased to 40%, as shown in Fig. 3e. Moreover,
the TPR of the FSDV framework is higher compared to PoW,
IDS, and TM schemes at all vehicle densities.
6) FPR: The increase in FPR increases rogue nodes in the
region as well as deteriorates the performance of the rogue
node detection schemes (Section V). In the FSDV framework,
the rogue nodes detection relies only on the speed values in
beacon messages broadcasted by all vehicles in the region
without taking into any trust scores or past vehicle data into
consideration resulting in 35% lower FPR compared to [4-6]

schemes. For a network with 40% rogue nodes, the FPR is
31%, 51%, and 38% lower than PoW, IDS, and TM schemes,
respectively, as shown in Fig. 3f.
VII. CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORK
We studied the challenges in detecting Sybil attacks, such as
high processing delay, high network overhead, low TPR, and
high FPR, notably when the number of rogue nodes increases
in the region. To address these limitations and to provide an
efﬁcient scheme to detect false messages broadcasted over the
network, we proposed an OBU-based fog computing technique
called FSDV to detect rogue nodes increases by up to 40%
in the region. The simulations were performed to evaluate the
performance of the FSDV framework using OMNET++ and
SUMO simulators. Results showed that the FSDV framework
is scalable, efﬁcient, robust, and performs up to 32% better
than [4-6] techniques. Moreover, the FSDV framework ensures
a 43% lower processing delay, 35% lower FPR, and 13% lower
overhead at high vehicle densities compared to existing Sybil
attack detection schemes [4-6].
Our framework does not depend on any roadside infras-
tructures like RSUs or trust scores or past vehicle data in
rogue nodes detection, which is a major advantage compared
to existing schemes [4-6, 8-12]. In the future, we are planning
to extend this work to detect various attacks, such as tunneling
attacks, impersonation attacks, etc. This can be done by
simulating the environment of the security attacks and then
detecting the malicious information broadcasted using rogue
nodes detection techniques.
